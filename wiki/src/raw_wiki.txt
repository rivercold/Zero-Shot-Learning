black footed albatross   wikipedia the black footed albatross phoebastria nigripes is a large seabird of the albatross family diomedeidae from the north pacific all but 25 of the population is found among the northwestern hawaiian islands it is one of three species of albatross that range in the northern hemisphere nesting on isolated tropical islands unlike many albatrosses it is dark plumagedtaxonomy edit black footed albatrosses are a type of albatross that belong to diomedeidae family and come from the procellariiformes order along with shearwaters fulmars storm petrels and diving petrels they share certain identifying features first they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns although the nostrils on the albatross are on the sides of the bill the bills of procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates finally they produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus this is used both against predators and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights 4  they also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage that helps desalinate their bodies to compensate for the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe it excretes a high saline solution from their nose 5 the specific epithet of nigripes is derived from two latin words niger meaning black and pes meaning foot 6 description edit the black footed albatross is a small member of the albatross family while still large compared to most other seabirds that has almost all black plumage some adults show white undertail coverts and all adults have white markings around the base of the beak and below the eye as the birds age they acquire more white at the base of the beak 7  8  its beak and feet are also all dark they have only the one plumage 7  9  they measure 68 to 74 cm 27–29 in 10  have a wingspan of 190 to 220 cm 62–72 ft 8  11  12  and weigh 26–43 kg 57–95 lb 13  males at an average weight of 34 kg 75 lb are larger than females at an average of 3 kg 66 lb 7 distribution and habitat edit the black footed albatross along with the laysan albatross and the rare short tailed albatross are the three species of albatross that range in the northern hemisphere as opposed to the rest of the family which range from the equator south there are at least 12 known breeding locations but 975 of the total population is found colonially on the isolated northwestern hawaiian islands from kure atoll to kaula island 3  such as laysan midway and the french frigate shoals small populations can be found on the japanese islands of tori shima bonin and senkaku and off the mexican coast primarily on isla guadalupe 14  they are extirpated from the iwo jima agrihan taongi atoll marcus island wake island and johnston island 3  their range at sea varies during the seasons straying farther from the breeding islands when the chicks are older or they dont have chicks but they make use of great areas of the north pacific feeding from alaska to california and japan however they do prefer the northeastern pacific ocean 14  they overlap greatly in breeding and feeding range with the other two species of northern albatross although the other two will range further north into the bering sea than the black footed will they have on occasion been sighted in the southern hemisphere 14 behavior edit their vocalization will range from shrieks and squeals whilst fighting over food to bill clapping whistles groans 9  and quacks while courting 8 breeding edit the black footed albatross like the rest of its family forms long term pair bonds that last for life after fledging the birds return to the colony after three years and spend two years building nests dancing and being with prospective mates a behaviour that probably evolved to ensure maximum trust between the birds raising an albatross chick is a massive energetic investment and a long courting period establishes for both birds that the other is committed they will start reproducing after about seven years 8 nests are simple depressions scraped in the sand 14  into which one dull white with reddish brown spots egg is laid 8  9  the egg is incubated for just over two months 65 days both birds incubate the egg the male incubating more as the female leaves soon after hatching to recoup reserves used for egg laying the average time spent on incubating shifts is 18 days however mates can wait up to 38 days to be relieved and if something happens to the mate the other has been recorded incubating for 49 days without food or waterthe chick is brooded for 20 days by its parents after which both parents leave the nest and return to feed the chick the chick is fed regurgitated food by sticking its bill inside that of its parent fledging occurs after 140 daysfeeding edit the black footed albatross feeds in pelagic waters taking the eggs of flying fish squid and to a lesser extent crustaceans it will also consume floating debris including plastics 8  14 conservation edit the black footed albatross is considered vulnerable by the iucn 1  because it is taken incidentally by longline fishing an estimated 4000 are taken every year based on the number taken in 1990 other estimates put the number at 8000 14  although more recent numbers are at around 6150 per year with the majority of deaths from taiwanese and japanese fishing fleets it is also vulnerable to oil and ingestion of floating plastics which reduces the space in the stomach available for food to be brought to the chick finally volcanic eruptions on torishima continues to be a threatthe black footed albatross has an occurrence range of 37600000 km2 14500000 sq mi and a breeding range of 28 km2 11 sq mi with a population of 129000 adult birds of these birds 24000 pairs breed on midway atoll and 21000 pairs breed on laysan island torishima has 1218 pairs the bonin islands have 23 pairs and there are about 400 pairs on offshore mexican islands with 337 on islas guadalupe all of these numbers come from estimates from 2005 to 2007 14 all of its nesting sites in the us are protected along with a 50 nmi 93 km buffer zone around these islands within this buffer zone longline fishing is outlawed almost 80 of the breeding population is counted or sampled each year and most fisheries utilize seabird bycatch prevention measures 14 gallery edit the dance at midway atollthe dance at midway atoll a b birdlife international 2013 phoebastria nigripes iucn red

laysan albatross   wikipedia the laysan albatross phoebastria immutabilis is a large seabird that ranges across the north pacific the northwestern hawaiian islands are home to 997 of the population this small for its family gull like albatross is the second most common seabird in the hawaiian islands with an estimated population of 25 million birds and is currently expanding or possibly re expanding its range to new islands the laysan albatross was first described as diomedea immutabilis by lionel walter rothschild in 1893 on the basis of a specimen from laysan island 3 etymology edit it is named for laysan one of its breeding colonies in the northwestern hawaiian islandsdescription edit the laysan albatross averages 81 cm 32 in in length 4  and has a wingspan of 195 to 203 cm 77–80 in 5  males which weigh 24 to 41 kg 53–90 lb are larger than females which weigh 19 to 36 kg 42–79 lb 6  7  this albatross has blackish gray upperwing mantle back upper rump and tail and its head lower rump and underparts are white it has a black smudge around the eye and its underwing pattern varies between individuals with some having narrower black margins and variable amounts of black in the underwing coverts finally the bill is pink with a dark tip juveniles have a gray bill and a dark upper rump 4  this species does not have a breeding plumage 6 the laysan albatross is usually easy to identify in the north pacific it is simple to separate from the other relatively common albatross the all black black footed albatross it can be distinguished from the very rare short tailed albatross by its all dark back and smaller size the laysan albatrosss plumage has been compared to that of a gull two toned with a dark gray mantle and wings and a white underside and headdistribution and habitat edit the laysan albatross has a wide range across the north pacific with 16 nesting sites all but 03 of the breeding population is found among the northwestern hawaiian islands particularly the islands of midway and laysan small populations are found on the bonin islands near japan and the french frigate shoals and the bird has begun to colonize islands off mexico such as guadalupe island 4  and others in the revillagigedo archipelago 5  when away from the breeding areas they range widely from japan to the bering sea and south to 15°n 4 behavior edit laysan albatross with chick on midwaythe at least 63 year old female named wisdom with her chick in march 2011the laysan albatross is normally a silent bird but on occasion they may be observed emitting long moo ing sounds descending whinnies or rattles 6  female laysan albatrosses may bond for life and cooperatively raise their young 8 a female laysan albatross named wisdom is the oldest known wild bird in the united states or the northern hemisphere wisdom was banded by a us geological survey researcher in 1956 and in february 2014 she was seen rearing a new chick on midway atoll because laysan albatrosses cant breed until they are five years old as of 2014 wisdom was estimated to be at least 63 years old 9  10 reproduction edit the laysan albatross is colonial nesting on scattered small islands and atolls often in huge numbers and builds different styles of nests depending on the surroundings ranging from simple scoops in the sand 11  to nests using vegetation 4  laysan albatrosses have a protracted breeding cycle they breed annually although some birds skip years 4  juvenile birds return to the colony three years after fledging but do not mate for the first time until seven or eight years old during these four or five years they form pair bonds with a mate that they will keep for life courtship entails especially elaborate dances that have up to 25 ritualized movementsoccasionally the birds form homosexual pairs consisting of two females this has been observed in the colony on the hawaiian island oahu where the sex ratio of male to female is 2 to 3 and 31 of all pairs are between females unpaired females pair up among themselves and successfully breed eggs are often fathered by paired males who cheat on their spouses 12 the single egg is buff white 11  and may have spots 13  both birds incubate the egg the male does so first incubation takes about 65 days and is followed by several weeks of brooding after which both parents are out at sea to provide for the growing chick the chick takes about 160 days to fledge this time investment by the parents may explain the long courtship both parents want to be sure the other is serious the chicks are fed a stomach oil by the parentsthe laysan albatross and the black footed albatross have been known to hybridize 5  6  like all albatrosses the laysan albatross is known to be a long living bird the oldest known live bird a female named wisdom is at least 64 years old 14  in 2014 she hatched a healthy chick which is believed to be her 36th 15  16  the longest lifespan confirmed for a wild seabird was for a breeding male laysan that was found to have been banded 53 years previously other albatross are thought to match or maybe even exceed this record but few confirmations of very old albatross exist 17 feeding edit the laysan albatross feeds predominantly on cephalopods 18  but will also eat fish crustaceans and other invertebrates 19 conservation edit the iucn has classified the laysan albatross as vulnerable due to drastic reductions in populations however recent studies when  show that the population may be rebounding 1  the iucn now classifies the laysan albatross as near threatened the laysan albatross while a common species has not yet recovered from the wide scale hunting of the early 1900s 4  with feather hunters killing many hundreds of thousands and wiping them out from wake island and johnston atoll 20  this slaughter led to efforts to protect the species and others which led eventually to the protection of the northwestern hawaiian islands 21  the species is still vulnerable to longline fisheries and the ingestion of floating plastics due to high rates of plastic pollution feral cats are known to prey on nesting birds and chicks on some of the more newly colonized islands in some places big headed ants are a threat to young albatross chicksthe laysan albatross has an occurrence range of 38800000 km2 15000000 sq mi and a breeding range of 3500 km2 1400 sq mi with a population of 1180000 mature birds estimated in 2006 4  midway atoll laysan island and the french frigate shoals have more than 90 of the breeding pairs at 551940 22  bonin island has 23 pairs and offshore mexico has about 400 pairs with 337 pairs on isla guadalupe 23  the northwestern hawaiian islands have suffered a 32 reduction in breeders from 1992 to 2002 24  25  however the last three years has seen a rebound that stabilized the period between 1992 and 2005 23  this species was extirpated from wake atoll johnston atoll and minami torishima the mexican population has been increasing since its inception 4 in the past harvesting for feathers was a major threat along with high seas drift nets however both of these have ceased barring some small scale illegal drift net operations current threats today are the longline fisheriesmidway atoll edit laysan albatross rookery on midway atolllead poisoning is killing thousands of laysan albatross each year on midway atoll part of the papahānaumokuākea marine national monument the laysan albatross has been globally listed as vulnerable to extinction by the world conservation union and is a special trust species on the midway atoll national wildlife refuge in the recently established national monumentlaysan chicks raised in nests close to 90 buildings left behind by the navy are ingesting lead based paint chips this is causing shockingly high lead concentrations in their blood leading to severe neurological disorders and eventual death said george fenwick president of american bird conservancy federal funds are urgently needed to clean up this toxic mess to protect the laysan albatross as well as future visitors to the new marine national monument 26  as many as 10000 chicks or five percent of hatched chicks may be killed annually by exposure to lead based paint many laysan chicks that nest within five meters of building structures exhibit a condition referred to as droopwing which commonly manifests itself in the chicks’ inability to raise their wings and which thus drag on the ground resulting in broken bones and open sores chicks with droopwing will never be able to fly and will die of starvation or dehydration other chicks in close proximity to buildings also suffer detrimental effects from lead exposure these chicks have blood lead concentrations that cause immunological neurological and renal impairments significantly decreasing their chances of survivalthe department of the interior doi estimates that 229 million is needed to clean up the toxic lead paint on midway atoll the 95 federally owned government buildings would need to be stripped of all lead based paint and sand areas surrounding these old buildings thoroughly sifted to remove lead paint chips when american bird conservancy staff presented the severity of this growing threat to an already imperiled bird species to doi officials they were told that the new northwestern hawaiian islands marine national monument did not have any federal funds dedicated to its operation moreover the doi officials stated that the current federal budget for the nation’s wildlife refuge system

crested auklet   wikipedia the crested auklet aethia cristatella is a small seabird of the family alcidae distributed throughout the northern pacific and the bering sea the species feeds by diving in deep waters eating krill and a variety of small marine animals it nests in dense colonies of up to 1 million individuals in the bering sea and the sea of okhotsk it often breeds in mixed species colonies with the least auklet a smaller congenerthe species is known for its sexual ornaments found in both males and females these include colorful plumage with a forehead crest a striking scent recalling citrus fruit and a loud trumpet call all of which appear to have evolved through sexual selection the total population is around 6 million almost half in north america it is in general considered to be of least concern though the alaskan population faces additional threats from predation and oil spillstaxonomy edit the crested auklet was first identified in 1769 by the german zoologist peter simon pallas who named it aethia cristatella the genus aethia includes four auklet species there are no subspecies of crested auklet 2  the family alcidae consists of many species of shorebirds including other auklets not in the genus aethia puffins razorbills guillemots and murres 3 description edit the crested auklet can measure 18–27 cm 71–106 in in length 34–50 cm 13–20 in in wingspan and weigh 195–330 g 69–116 oz 4  they have a reddish orange and yellow tipped bill yellowish white irises and white auricular plumes from their eyes to their ears their bodies wings and tails are primarily dark sooty grey while their legs and feet are grey and claws black the males and females are very similar although the females have slightly smaller and less curved bills additionally slightly smaller crests 2 crested auklets are known for their forehead crests which is made of black forward curving feathers these forehead crests are highly variable and can have between two and twenty three narrow forward curving feathers the average auklet has 12 crest feathers which are of variable length between 81 and 585 millimetres 5  auklets have auricular plumes and a bright orange bill with curved accessory plates 6  like forehead crests these features vary widely within auklet populations 2 the crested auklet is recognized primarily by two characteristics during the breeding season the first is its crest a group of bristle feathers located on top of its head above its eyes the second is a social odor that the auklets produce during the breeding season described as smelling like tangerines this odor originates from tiny wick feathers located in a small patch of skin between the shoulder blades 7  in winter plumage their bills are smaller and dull yellow they lack accessory plates and their crest and auricular plumes are reduced 2 juveniles are similar to winter adults but without auricular and crest plumes their bills are smaller and colored a dull brownish yellow 2  juveniles take 33 days to reach adult size 8 habitat and distribution edit crested auklets on a cliffsidecrested auklets are found throughout the northern pacific ocean and bering sea they are particularly prevalent during the non breeding winter months along the aleutian islands kuril islands and the russian island of sakhalin they travel to breeding locations on the islands and shorelines of the sea of okhotsk and the bering sea during the late spring and summer 1  their habitats consist of slopes boulder fields lava flows and sea cliffs they are often found with other auklet species such as the least auklet 2  on a daily basis crested auklets circle 500 meters above the sea and the breeding colonies this circling is triggered by disturbances and predators posing a threat 8 behavior and ecology edit crested auklets primarily forage in deep waters however sometimes in areas closer to the shore but always in large flocks little is known about the winter diets however it is suggested that they feed on a variety of marine invertebrates crested auklets are planktivores their diet consists mainly of krill but they are also known to eat copepods pteropods such as limacina amphipods and larval fishes 2  crested auklets dive from the surface of the water to catch their food this behavior has been described as underwater flight 9 breeding and parental care edit the crested auklet breeding season begins mid may and ends mid august 10  their nesting sites are within the rocky crevices of north pacific coast they breed in dense colonies of up to one million birds because of this nesting sites are in close proximity with as little as 03 meters between nests even so there is a high degree of territoriality and adults show a high degree of site fidelity within a year 11  because mating occurs at sea and males have no copulatory organ males must hover over females for a successful mating mate choice is mutual but females do have final choice on breeding partner 7 crested auklets are highly social during the breeding season before pair formation and after pair formation within a breeding year however crested auklets are monogamous with only 10 of the population having extra pair copulations partners continue to self advertise to other birds when they are not incubating while some of this advertising behavior can be linked to extra pair mating it is suggested that continuation of the behavior allows birds to find pairs for the next breeding season only 455 of birds remain with the same partner in the subsequent breeding season 7 both sexes invest highly in parental care parents share equally in incubating the single egg and raising the chick since both sexes are ornamented crested auklets align with robert triverss parental investment theory which predicts that with biparental care mutual choosiness will arise 12 sexual selection edit crested auklets are unique in their use of optical vocal and olfactory signals in mating their communicative behavior is more complex and diversified than that of closely related species there are three general evolutionary mechanisms proposed to address the origin of the elaborate display traits of crested auklets and of showy mating signals by males in generalrunaway selection fisher’s theory of runaway sexual selection explains flamboyant traits in males as resulting from a genetic linkage between ornamental traits and a mating preference for such ornaments under this model mating preferences could be spread by arbitrary or even deleterious traits that carry no benefits to fitness besides sexual selection 13 the good genes hypothesis the second mechanism is the good genes or handicap processes where mating preference focuses on ornamental traits that reflect the health or viability of the individual expressing them these good genes convey genetic benefits to the offspring 14  amotz zahavi proposed the handicap hypothesis where he suggests that individuals’ ornamental traits are indicators of good fitness because they reflect the individual’s success in spite of these traits as handicaps 14 sensory exploitation the third proposed mechanism is sexual selection for sensory exploitation which results in mating preferences that arise due to natural selection for inherent sensory biases mutations occur that result in a display trait which exploits the pre existing sensory bias 15 ornamentation edit visual ornaments edit 1838 illustration of an adultasserted dominance with regards to claimed display area has been correlated with crest length in both males and females the existence of these showy monomorphic traits is indicative of intense sexual selection for both sexes large crested adults of both sexes receive higher levels of sexual interest and displays from the opposite sex compared to those with smaller crests 5  crested auklets with larger crests are more likely to obtain mates and to form pair bonds earlier 5 based on divorce rate and mortality more than half of individuals find a new mate each year 6  female crest length is the primary factor of male mate switching between years 16 while there is variation in displays across populations crested auklet crests and plume ornaments are consistent in expression within an individual over time furthermore there is little sexual dimorphism or evidence of condition dependence from studies it seems to be a survival neutral ornament 10  some studies however offer up a functional purpose for these ornaments one study suggests a link between habitat complexity and facial feathering where tactile facial elongation helps individuals navigate complex underground crevices 17  the high density of crested auklet nesting sites can be expected to impose selective pressures on sensory mechanisms 17 vocal ornaments edit crested auklets have a wide variety of single and complex calls billing is defined as pair courtship with mutual cackling vocal display it is a crucial part of successful pair formation and becomes harmonious once male and female partners are well acquainted 7  trumpet calls are one of the most common advertising calls the call represents a complex but stereotyped vocal sequence that is linked with a specific visual display 11  between individuals the calls differ in duration and frequency calls are primarily performed in males but can also be seen in females the call is particularly strong in widowed females 7  these calls stay stable from year to year and individuals specific calls are associated with the maintenance of long term social bonds between pair mates and between neighbors this suggests that trumpet calls can be used for both short term and long term individual recognition recognition of neighboring individuals calls is advantageous because it minimizes energy expenditure on aggressive displays and prevents conflict between neighbors and trusted individuals the dear enemy phenomenon 11 olfactory ornaments edit crested auklets have a distinctive citrus like plumage odor the scent is released when there is ruffling of feathers on the nape and upper back of the individual from threat trumpeting or billing displays the cloud of scent released encourages the ruff sniff display a ruff sniff display is when birds fully insert their half open bill into the others plumage this display occurs in the absence of obvious aggression and is important for pair formation 7  for both sexes a strong odor attracts more individuals which then do a ruff sniff display 16 odor secretions increase during the breeding season highlighting its association with courtship and mate selection the scent may also act as an ectoparasite repellent 18  this scent is also found in whiskered auklet 8 conservation status edit according to the international union for conservation of nature crested auklets are of least concern 1  the global population is estimated to be six million individuals while the north american population is estimated at 29 million birds however an accurate assessment of the number of birds is difficult since those on the surface of the colony and in the nearby sea form only a small proportion of the variable and poorly understood population 19 there is greater concern for the alaskan population there has been high predation by rats which have escaped from fishing vessels in the harbor the auklets main predators are gulls arctic fox and common ravens they have also been reported in the stomachs of halibut caught on st lawrence island oil spills and collisions with light sources pose additional risks in alaska there is some subsistence hunting of the species 9 references edit  a b c birdlife international 2012 aethia cristatella iucn red list of threatened species

red winged blackbird   wikipedia the red winged blackbird agelaius phoeniceus is a passerine bird of the family icteridae found in most of north and much of central america it breeds from alaska and newfoundland south to florida the gulf of mexico mexico and guatemala with isolated populations in western el salvador northwestern honduras and northwestern costa rica it may winter as far north as pennsylvania and british columbia but northern populations are generally migratory moving south to mexico and the southern united states claims have been made that it is the most abundant living land bird in north america as bird counting censuses of wintering red winged blackbirds sometimes show that loose flocks can number in an excess of a million birds per flock and the full number of breeding pairs across north and central america may exceed 250 million in peak years it also ranks among the best studied wild bird species in the world 2  3  4  5  6  the red winged blackbird is sexually dimorphic the male is all black with a red shoulder and yellow wing bar while the female is a nondescript dark brown seeds and insects make up the bulk of the red winged blackbirds diettaxonomy edit the red winged blackbird is one of 11 species in the genus agelaius and is included in the family icteridae which is made up of passerine birds found in north and south america 7  the red winged blackbird was originally described as oriolus phoeniceus by linnaeus in his 18th century work systema naturae 8  but was later moved with the other american blackbirds to the genus agelaius vieillot 1816 9  the genus name is latin derived from ancient greek agelaios meaning belonging to a flock the specific epithet phoeniceus is from the latin word meaning deep red 10 there are a number of subspecies some of doubtful status which are mostly quite similar in appearance but the bicolored blackbird a p gubernator of california and central mexico – two isolated populations – is distinctive the male lacks the yellow wing patch of the nominate race and the female is much darker than the female nominate the taxonomy of this form is little understood with the relationships between these two populations and between them and red winged blackbirds still unclear 11  despite the similar names the red winged blackbird is in a different family from the european redwing and the old world common blackbird which are thrushes turdidae 7 description edit the common name for the red winged blackbird is taken from the mainly black adult males distinctive red shoulder patches or epaulets which are visible when the bird is flying or displaying 12  at rest the male also shows a pale yellow wingbar the female is blackish brown and paler below the female is smaller than the male at 17–18 cm 67–71 in long and weighing 415 g 146 oz against his length of 22–24 cm 87–94 in and weight of 64 g 23 oz 13  the smallest females may weigh as little as 29 g 10 oz whereas the largest males can weigh up to 82 g 29 oz 14  each wing can range from 81–144 cm 32–57 in the tail measures 61–109 cm 24–43 in the culmen measures 13–32 cm 051–126 in and the tarsus measures 21 cm 083 in 11 young birds resemble the female but are paler below and have buff feather fringes both sexes have a sharply pointed bill the tail is of medium length and is rounded the eyes bill and feet are all black 15 the male is unmistakable except in the far west of the us where the tricolored blackbird occurs males of that species have a darker red epaulet edged with white not yellow females of tricolored bicolored red shouldered and red winged blackbirds can be difficult to identify in areas where more than one form occurs in flight when the field marks are not easily seen red winged can be distinguished from less closely related icterids such as common grackle and brown headed cowbird by its different silhouette and undulating flight 11 distribution and habitat edit the range of the red winged blackbird stretches from southern alaska to the yucatan peninsula in the south and from the western coast of california and canada to the east coast of the continent red winged blackbirds in the northern reaches of the range are migratory spending winters in the southern united states and central america migration begins in september or october but occasionally as early as august in western and middle america populations are generally non migratory  16 the red winged blackbird inhabits open grassy areas it generally prefers wetlands and inhabits both freshwater and saltwater marshes particularly if cattail is present it is also found in dry upland areas where it inhabits meadows prairies and old fields 16 behavior edit vocalisations edit the calls of the red winged blackbird are a throaty check and a high slurred whistle terrr eeee the males song accompanied by a display of his red shoulder patches is a scratchy oak a lee 17  except that in many western birds including bicolored blackbirds it is oopreeeeeom 18  the female also sings typically a scolding chatter chit chit chit chit chit chit cheer teer teer teerr 11 predation edit virtually all of north americas raptors take adult or young red winged blackbirds even barn owls which usually only take small mammals and northern saw whet owls which are scarcely larger than a male red winged accipiter hawks are among their most prolific predators and locally they are one of the preferred prey species of short tailed hawks 19  crows ravens magpies and herons are occasionally predators of blackbird nests additional predators of blackbirds of all ages and their eggs include raccoons mink foxes and snakes especially the rat snake marsh wrens destroy the eggs at least sometimes drinking from them and peck the nestlings to death 20 the red winged blackbird aggressively defends its territory from other animals it will attack much larger birds 21  males have been known to swoop at humans who encroach upon their nesting territory during breeding season 22  23 the maximum longevity of the red winged blackbird in the wild is 158 years 24 the red winged blackbird is omnivorous it feeds primarily on plant materials including seeds from weeds and waste grain such as corn and rice but about a quarter of its diet consists of insects and other small animals and considerably more so during breeding season 25  it prefers insects such as dragonflies damselflies butterflies moths and flies but also consumes snails frogs eggs carrion worms spiders mollusks the red winged blackbird forages for insects by picking them from plants or by catching them in flight 15  in season it eats blueberries blackberries and other fruit these birds can be lured to backyard bird feeders by bread and seed mixtures and suet in late summer and in autumn the red winged blackbird will feed in open fields mixed with grackles cowbirds and starlings in flocks which can number in the thousands 21 breeding edit the red winged blackbird nests in loose colonies the nest is built in cattails rushes grasses sedge or in alder or willow bushes the nest is constructed entirely by the female over the course of three to six days it is a basket of grasses sedge and mosses lined with mud and bound to surrounding grasses or branches 15  it is located 76 cm 30 in to 43 m 14 ft above water 26 a clutch consists of three or four rarely five eggs eggs are oval smooth and slightly glossy and measure 248 mm × 1755 mm 0976 in × 0691 in 26  they are pale bluish green marked with brown purple andor black with most markings around the larger end of the egg these are incubated by the female alone and hatch in 11 to 12 days red winged blackbirds are hatched blind and naked but are ready to leave the nest 11 to 14 days after hatching 13 red winged blackbirds are polygynous with territorial males defending up to 10 females however females frequently copulate with males other than their social mate and often lay clutches of mixed paternity pairs raise two or three clutches per season in a new nest for each clutch 13 predation of eggs and nestlings is quite common nest predators include snakes mink raccoons and other birds even as small as marsh wrens the red winged blackbird is occasionally a victim of brood parasites particularly brown headed cowbirds 21  since nest predation is common several adaptations have evolved in this species group nesting is one such trait which reduces the risk of individual predation by increasing the number of alert parents nesting over water reduces the likelihood of predation as do alarm calls nests in particular offer a strategic advantage over predators in that they are often well concealed in thick waterside reeds and positioned at a height of one to two meters 27  males often act as sentinels employing a variety of calls to denote the kind and severity of danger mobbing especially by males is also used to scare off unwanted predators although mobbing often targets large animals and man made devices by mistake the brownish coloration of the female may also serve as an anti predator trait in that it may provide camouflage for her and her nest while she is incubating 16  adults are vulnerable to a multitude of raptorial birds at least 16 species have hunted them in north america including all accipiter hawks and falcons as well as most species of buteo hawk and any owls that hunt in open or wetland habitats 28  29 migration edit red winged blackbirds that breed in the northern part of their range ie canada and border states in the united states migrate south for the winter however populations near the pacific and gulf coasts of north america and those of middle america are year round resident 2  red winged blackbirds live in both northern us and canada ranging from yucatan peninsula in the south to the southern part of alaska 2  these extensions account for the majority of the continent stretching from california’s pacific coast and canada to the eastern seaboard much of the populations within middle america are non migratory  30  during the fall populations begin migrating towards southern us movement of red winged blackbirds can begin as early as august through october spring migration begins anywhere between mid february to mid may numerous birds from northern parts of the us particularly the great lakes migrate nearly 1200 km between their breeding season and winter  2  winter territorial areas differ based on geographic location  30  other populations that migrate year round include those located in middle america or in the western us and gulf coast females typically migrate longer distances than males these female populations located near the great lakes migrate nearly 230 km farther yearly traveled females also migrate further than adult males while also moving roughly the same distance as other adult females red winged blackbirds migrate primarily during daytime in general males’ migration flocks arrive prior to females in the spring and after females in the fall 2 territorial edit the perched display with wings held away from the body is an agonistic behavior of the red winged blackbirdmale red winged blackbirds exhibit important territorial behaviors most of which provides them with the necessary fidelity for many years to come a few important factors for male red winged blackbirds’ adherence to territories included food hiding spaces from predators types of neighbors and reactions towards predators additionally a study was done on site fidelity and movement patterns by les d beletsky and gordon h orians in 1987 which explained much of the males’ territorial behaviors once migrated and settled onto a territory of their own sufficient evidence had shown that males are committed to staying in their territory over a long period of time and are not more likely to change territories at a younger age due to limited experience of knowledge for success studies also showed that most of the males that were first time movers to a new territory were between two and three years old the majority of males that moved were young and inexperienced later on they had moved towards more available territories if males had chosen to leave their territory for reproductive success as an example they would do so within a short distance males who moved shorter distances were more successful in reproducing than those who moved longer distances further studies showed that when males moved further away from their territories there was a decrease in probability of successfully fledging  31 relationship with humans edit in winter the species forage away from marshes taking seeds and grain from open fields and agricultural areas it is sometimes considered an agricultural pest 11  farmers have been known to use pesticides—such as parathion—in illegal attempts to control their populations 32  in the united states such efforts are illegal because no pesticide can be used on non target organisms or for any use not explicitly listed on the pesticides label however the usda has deliberately poisoned this species in 2009 the animal and plant health inspection service reported poisoning over 950000 red winged blackbirds in texas and louisiana 33  this poisoning has been implicated as a potential cause of the decline of the rusty blackbird a once abundant species that has declined 99 since the 1960s and has been recently listed as threatened on the iucn red list 34 like english the indigenous languages of the birds range describe it by its physical

rumps adult females are mostly light brown although their coloring includes black streaks on the back and flanks and dark stripes on the head their wings and tails are darker the collective name for a group of bobolinks is a chain 5 distribution and movements edit the bobolink breeds in the summer in north america across much of southern canada and the northern united states 6  it migrates long distances wintering in southern south america 6  in argentina bolivia brazil and paraguay citation needed  one bird was tracked migrating 12000 mi 19000 km over the course of the year often flying long distances up to 1100 mi 1800 km in a single day then stopping to recuperate for days or weeks 7 they often migrate in flocks feeding on cultivated grains and rice which leads to them being considered a pest by farmers in some areas although bobolinks migrate long distances they have rarely been sighted in europe—like many vagrants from the americas the overwhelming majority of records are from the british isles citation needed the species has been known in the southern united states as the reedbird or the ricebird from their consumption of large amounts of the grain from rice fields in south carolina and the gulf states during their southward migration in the fall 8  9  10  one of the species main migration routes is through jamaica where theyre called butter birds and at least historically were collected as food having fattened up on the aforementioned rice 9  10 behaviour edit breeding edit their breeding habitats are open grassy fields especially hay fields across north america in high quality habitats males are often polygynous females lay five to six eggs in a cup shaped nest which is always situated on the ground and is usually well hidden in dense vegetation both parents feed the youngfeeding edit bobolinks forage on or near the ground and mainly eat seeds and insectsmales sing bright bubbly songs in flightstatus and conservation edit the numbers of these birds are declining due to loss of habitat bobolinks are a species at risk in nova scotia 11  and throughout canada 12  in vermont a 75 decline was noted between 1966 and 2007 4  originally they were found in tall grass prairie and other open areas with dense grass although hay fields are suitable nesting habitat fields which are harvested early or at multiple times in a season may not allow sufficient time for young birds to fledge delaying hay harvests by just 15 weeks can improve bobolink survival by 20  11  this species increased in numbers when horses were the primary mode of transportation requiring larger supplies of haymedia references edit emily dickinson penned many poems about the bird edgar allan poe mentions the bird in landors cottagethe bobolink

indigo bunting   wikipedia the indigo bunting passerina cyanea is a small seed eating bird in the family cardinalidae it is migratory ranging from southern canada to northern florida during the breeding season and from southern florida to northern south america during the winter 2  it often migrates by night using the stars to navigate 3  its habitat is farmland brush areas and open woodland 4  the indigo bunting is closely related to the lazuli bunting and interbreeds with the species where their ranges overlapthe indigo bunting is a small bird with a length of 115–13 cm 45–51 in it displays sexual dimorphism in its coloration the male is a vibrant blue in the summer and a brown color during the winter months while the female is brown year round the male displays brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate nest building and incubation are done solely by the female the diet of the indigo bunting consists primarily of insects during the summer months and seeds during the winter monthstaxonomy edit the indigo bunting is included in the family cardinalidae which is made up of passerine birds found in north and south america and is one of seven birds in the genus passerina 5  it was originally described as tanagra cyanea by linnaeus in his 18th century work systema naturae the current genus name passerina is derived from the latin term passer for true sparrows and similar small birds 6  while the species name cyanea is from the latin word meaning dark or sea blue 7 the indigo bunting is closely related to the lazuli bunting and interbreeds with the species where their ranges overlap in the great plains 8  they were declared to form a superspecies by the american ornithologists union in 1983 9  however according to sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of members of the genus passerina it was determined that the indigo bunting and lazuli bunting are not in fact sister taxa the indigo bunting is the sister of two sister groups a “blue” lazuli bunting and blue grosbeak and a “painted” rositas bunting orange breasted bunting varied bunting and painted bunting clade this genetic study shows these species diverged between 41 and 73 million years ago this timing which is consistent with fossil evidence coincides with a late miocene cooling which caused the evolution of a variety of western grassland habitats evolving to reduce size may have allowed buntings to exploit grass seeds as a food source 10 description edit juvenile male indigo bunting at smith oaks sanctuary high islandthe indigo bunting is a smallish songbird around the size of a small sparrow it measures 115–15 cm 45–59 in long with a wingspan of 18–23 cm 71–91 in 11  2  body mass averages 145 g 051 oz with a reported range of 112–214 g 040–075 oz 12  during the breeding season the adult male appears mostly a vibrant cerulean blue only the head is indigo the wings and tail are black with cerulean blue edges in fall and winter plumage the male has brown edges to the blue body and head feathers which overlap to make the bird appear mostly brown the adult female is brown on the upperparts and lighter brown on the underparts it has indistinct wing bars and is faintly streaked with darker markings underneath 13  the immature bird resembles the female in coloring although a male may have hints of blue on the tail and shoulders and have darker streaks on the underside the beak is short and conical in the adult female the beak is light brown tinged with blue and in the adult male the upper half is brownish black while the lower is light blue 14  the feet and legs are black or gray 15 distribution and habitat edit the habitat of the indigo bunting is brushy forest edges open deciduous woods second growth woodland and farmland 4  the breeding range stretches from southern canada to maine south to northern florida and eastern texas and westward to southern nevada the winter range begins in southern florida and central mexico and stretches south through the west indies and central america to northern south america 2  it has occurred as a vagrant in antigua and barbuda barbados denmark ecuador germany iceland ireland netherlands the netherlands antilles saint pierre and miquelon serbia and the united kingdom 1 behavior edit the indigo bunting communicates through vocalizations and visual cues a sharp chip call is used by both sexes and is used as an alarm call if a nest or chick is threatened a high pitched buzzed zeeep is used as a contact call when the indigo bunting is in flight 16  the song of the male bird is a high pitched buzzed sweet sweet chew chew sweet sweet lasting two to four seconds sung to mark his territory to other males and to attract females each male has a single complex song 15  which he sings while perched on elevated objects such as posts wires and bush tops 17  in areas where the ranges of the lazuli bunting and the indigo bunting overlap the males defend territories from each another 18  migration takes place in april and may and then again in september and october 2  the indigo bunting often migrates during the night using the stars to navigate 3  in captivity since it cannot migrate it experiences disorientation in april and may and in september and october if it cannot see the stars from its enclosure 2 breeding edit a male in breeding plumagethese birds are generally monogamous but not always faithful to their partner in the western part of their range they often hybridize with the lazuli bunting nesting sites are located in dense shrub or a low tree generally 03–1 m 098–328 ft above the ground but rarely up to 9 m 30 ft 18  the nest itself is constructed of leaves coarse grasses stems and strips of bark lined with soft grass or deer hair and is bound with spider web it is constructed by the female who cares for the eggs alone 18  the clutch consists of one to four eggs but usually contains three to four the eggs are white and usually unmarked though some may be marked with brownish spots averaging 187 mm × 137 mm 074 in × 054 in in size 19  the eggs are incubated for 12 to 13 days and the chicks are altricial at hatching 2  chicks fledge 10 to 12 days after hatching most pairs raise two broods per year and the male may feed newly fledged young while the females incubate the next clutch of eggs 20 the brown headed cowbird may parasitize this species 11  indigo buntings abandon their nest if a cowbird egg appears before they lay any of their own eggs but accept the egg after that point pairs with parasitized nests have less reproductive success the bunting chicks hatch but have lower survival rates as they must compete with the cowbird chick for food 21 the indigo bunting forages for food on the ground or in trees or shrubs 18  in winter it often feeds in flocks with other indigo buntings but is a solitary feeder during the breeding season 15  during the breeding season the species eats insects seeds and berries including caterpillars grasshoppers spiders beetles and grass seeds the seeds of grasses are the mainstay of its diet during the winter although buds and insects are eaten when available the young are fed mainly insects at first to provide them with protein 18  the indigo bunting does not drink frequently generally obtaining sufficient water from its diet 15 the species is classified as being of least concern according to the iucn with an estimated range of 5900000 km2 2300000 sq mi and a population of 28 million individuals global population trends have not been quantified but the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for a population decline warranting an upgrade in conservation status 1  the criteria for a change in conservation status are a decline of more than 30 in ten years or over three generations 1 references edit  a b c d birdlife international 2012 passerina cyanea iucn red list of threatened species version 20132 international union for conservation of nature

lazuli bunting   wikipedia the lazuli bunting passerina amoena is a north american songbird named for the gemstone lapis lazulithe male is easily recognized by its bright blue head and back lighter than the closely related indigo bunting its conspicuous white wingbars and its light rusty breast and white belly the color pattern may suggest the eastern and western bluebirds but the smaller size 13–14 cm or 5–55 inches long wingbars and short and conical bunting bill quickly distinguish it the female is brown grayer above and warmer underneath told from the female indigo bunting by two thin and pale wingbars and other plumage detailsthe song is a high rapid strident warble similar to that of the indigo bunting but longer and with less repetitionupper figure male lower femalelazuli buntings breed mostly west of the 100th meridian from southern canada to northern texas central new mexico and arizona and southern california on the pacific coast their breeding range extends south to extreme northwestern baja california they migrate to southeastern arizona and mexico their habitat is brushy areas and sometimes weedy pastures generally well watered and sometimes in townsthese birds eat mostly seeds and insects they may feed conspicuously on the ground or in bushes but singing males are often very elusive in treetopsthis bird makes a loose cup nest of grasses and rootlets placed in a bush it lays three or four pale blue eggs in the eastern and southern part of its range it often hybridizes with the indigo buntingreferences edit external links edit 
painted bunting   wikipedia the painted bunting passerina ciris is a species of bird in the cardinal family cardinalidae that is native to north america the bright plumage of the male only comes in the second year of life in the first year they can only be distinguished from the female by close inspectiontaxonomy edit the painted bunting was originally described by carl linnaeus in his eighteenth century work systema naturae 2  there are two recognized subspecies of the painted bunting 3  4 p c ciris – linnaeus 1758 nominate breeds in the southeastern united statesp c pallidior – mearns 1911 breeds in south central us and northern mexicodescription edit painted bunting from the birds of americathe male painted bunting is often described as the most beautiful bird in north america and as such has been nicknamed nonpareil or without equal 5  its colors dark blue head green back red rump and underparts make it extremely easy to identify but it can still be difficult to spot since it often skulks in foliage even when it is singing the plumage of female and juvenile painted buntings is green and yellow green serving as camouflage once seen the adult female is still distinctive since it is a brighter truer green than other similar songbirds adult painted buntings can measure 12–14 cm 47–55 in in length span 21–23 cm 83–91 in across the wings and weigh 13–19 g 046–067 oz 6  7 the juveniles have two inserted moults in their first autumn each yielding plumage like an adult females the first starts a few days after fledging replacing the juvenile plumage with an auxiliary formative plumage the second a month or so later giving the formative plumage 8 distribution and habitat edit the painted bunting occupies typical habitat for a member of its family it is found in thickets woodland edges with riparian thickets shrubbery and brushy areas in the east the species breeds in maritime hammocks and scrub communities today it is often found along roadsides and in suburban areas and in gardens with dense shrubby vegetation the wintering habitat is typically the shrubby edges along the border of tropical forests or densely vegetated savanna 9  the breeding range is divided into two geographically separate areas these include southern arizona southern new mexico southern and eastern texas oklahoma arkansas louisiana northern florida coastal georgia the southern coast and inland waterways such as the santee river of south carolina and northern mexico 1  they winter in south florida cuba the bahamas along both coasts of mexico and through much of central america occasionally they may be vagrants further north including to new york 10  11  pennsylvania 12  and new jersey 13  the bird is also found every few years as far north as new brunswick canada 14 behavior edit painted buntings are shy secretive and often difficult to observe for the human eye though can be fairly approachable where habituated to bird feeders males sing in spring from exposed perches to advertise their territories they also engage in visual displays including flying bouncingly like a butterfly or in an upright display body fluff display bow display and wing quiver display these displays are used in agonistic conflicts with other males or in breeding displays for females with females rarely engaging in displays occasionally males may physically clash with each other and may even kill each other in such conflicts 6  when their breeding season has concluded buntings migrate by night over short to medium distances western birds arizona and northern mexico molt in mid migration while eastern birds tend to molt before they migrate 9 feeding edit painted buntings often feed by hopping along the ground cautiously stopping every few moments to look around the painted bunting regularly eats a large quantity of grass seeds including panicum amaranthus oxalis euphorbia and carex seeds are eaten almost exclusively during winter while breeding painted bunting and nestlings mainly eat small invertebrates including spiders snails grasshoppers caterpillars and other insects they have been known to regularly visit spider webs to pick off small insects caught in them 9 breeding edit painted buntings are mostly monogamous and are solitary or in pairs during the breeding season but sometimes exhibit polygyny the breeding season begins in late april and lasts through to early august with activity peaking mid may through to mid july the male arrives about a week before the female and starts to establish a small territory the nest is typically hidden in low dense vegetation and is built by the females and woven into the surrounding vegetation for strength 9  each brood contains three or four gray white eggs often spotted with brown which are incubated for around 10 days until the altricial young are hatched the female alone cares for the young the hatchlings are brooded for approximately 12 to 14 days and then fledge at that time about 30 days after the first eggs hatch the female painted bunting usually lays a second brood 9  nests are often parasitized by cowbirds 9  common predators at the nest of eggs young and brooding females are large snakes including coachwhip snakes eastern kingsnakes eastern racers and black rat snakes 9  bird hunting raptors including short tailed hawks accipiter hawks and even the small passerine loggerhead shrike may hunt painted buntings including the conspicuous breeding plumaged male the painted bunting can live to over 10 years of age though most wild buntings probably live barely half that long 9 the male painted bunting was once a very popular caged bird but its capture and holding is currently illegal 15  trapping for overseas sale may still occur in central america 9  populations are primarily declining due to habitat being lost to development especially in coastal swamp thickets and woodland edges in the east and riparian habitats in migration and winter in the southeastern united states and mexico 9  they are categorized as near threatened by the iucn 1  and are protected by the us migratory bird actreferences edit lanyon sm thompson cf 1986 site fidelity

spotted catbird   wikipedia the spotted catbird ailuroedus maculosus is a species of bowerbird ptilonorhynchidae which can be found in north queensland australia and the island of new guinea including its surrounding islands 2  although it is a member of the bowerbird family it does not build a bowerwidespread and common throughout its large range the spotted catbird is evaluated as least concern on iucn red list of threatened speciestaxonomy edit the spotted catbird is one of ten species in the genus ailuroedus the non bower building bowerbirds the noticeable difference between the two australian dwelling species is the lack of black ear coverts and reduction in dorsal spotting on a cassirostris 3  molecular evidence suggests ailuroedus is a sister group to the other bowerbirds diverging into the only genus within the eight species of australian bowerbirds that is monogamous and does not build a bower or clear a court for mating 4  5  the other bowerbirds are polygynous and make various forms of bowers or create stages for mating 6  one study revealed the catbirds have a smaller brain for their body size compared to the bower building species 7  until 2016 a maculosus was considered a subspecies of either a melanotis then also named the spotted catbird or as a subspecies of a crassirostris green catbirdhabitat edit the spotted catbird is an australo papuan species it can be found in tropical rainforest and is locally common in its range 8  within australia it has two isolated populations both located in far north queensland one group occurs on cape york and the other further south in the wet tropics region 2  3  the tropical forests of the bellenden ker range and adjoining scrub area from cardwell to cooktown may be the species headquarters 9  spotted catbirds are a highly specialized rainforest species and in the australian wet tropics they prefer to nest in well vegetated areas with steep creek slopes and also in forests with calamus tangles and will nest in the same location year after year 10  11  they have a home range of 1 2 hectares and forage about 68 m from their nests 10 habitat threats edit destruction of their rainforest habitat and rising temperatures could pose a threat to the spotted catbird 12  there have been attempts at revegetation on the atherton tablelands in north queensland this has resulted in habitat heterogeneity these attempts may not be helpful to the habitat specific species 13  this rainforest fragmentation creates corridors in the attempt to provide habitat for rainforest birds these corridors are subject to edge effects and go unused by the specialized rainforest species 14  however they have been regularly detected in well established rainforest regrowth in australia 15 description edit spotted catbirds are 26–30 cm 16  males weigh 180g and females weigh 168g 2  adults have a large dusky colored head with a blackish cap and black ear patch they have mostly bright green upperparts with heavy olive chevrons and white streaking on the underbody 2  16  they have slim white wing bars and a white tipped green tail 8  the eye is red and it has a stout cream colored beak 8  16  the legs and feet are dark to bluish grey 2  males and females have similar plumage 17  their coloring differs from other bowerbirds which have a plumage color pattern consisting of a mixture of two colors of various proportions 18  the cryptic plumage coloring of the catbird aids in parental care by helping the catbird blend into its surroundings allowing males and females to tend to the nestlings 19  it may also allow spotted catbirds to spend more time foraging as they blend into the surrounding foliage 20  their voice is described as loud with cat like wailing they produce a nasal here i arr call with sharp clicks and three loud cries 8  they can be heard calling all times of the day especially at dawn and dusk and call more frequently on during cooler temperatures with dewy mornings and after rain 21 behavior edit a curious spotted catbird in the wet tropics of queensland australiathe following notes were made in regard to the spotted catbird’s curious personality on entering a scrub from the roadside one may hear a catbird call perhaps a hundred yards away the bird will probably call several times in the next few minutes advancing nearer and each time until at last the bird will be seen arriving on a branch close to the intruder where it will continue its harah calling at intervals whilst watching closely its human neighbour in all probability after a short interval the bird’s mate will arrive in answer to the calls of the first bird 21  they exhibit arboreal displays similar to other passerines 22 spotted catbird eating fruit in the rainforest of queensland australiathe spotted catbird is mainly frugivorous 23  they have been seen foraging at varying altitudinal levels 24  they often forage on the ground and use their strong feet and powerful bills to eat small structurally unprotected fruit under 10mm in diameter they also eat large structurally unprotected fruit between 13 21mm in diameter 25  their bright green plumage may prevent them from joining foraging flocks of brown and black colored birds in the rainforest 23  in one observation from cooktown australia a lady stated that spotted catbirds become very bold during cumquat season and were observed feeding alongside honeyeaters on mandarins in a nearby site 26  they eat the seeds of palms wild figs berries from the stinging tree and all kinds of soft fruit spotted catbirds will also eat beetles and insects as well as new buds and shoots of ferns 21  the adults and nestlings have also been observed feeding on cicadas with parents and adults feeding cicadas to nestlings 27  spotted catbirds have also been photographed attacking nests on the ground and have even been observed feeding nestlings taken from nests to their young 28  in one study the imprints from the bill closely resembled the marks on dummy eggs in 879 of the 66 nests depredated by birds 29  spotted catbirds are also known to eat birds that have become trapped in mist nets 19  nestlings are also fed decapitated heads and other parts of fruit dove squabs 10  it has also been suggested that catbirds eat small soft shelled snails 30 reproduction edit the ailuroedus genus of the bowerbird family consists of monogamous pairs that do not build a bower the males and females both defend an all purpose territory spotted catbirds form pair bonds some which are known to last for more than one breeding season and it is believed that this monogamy results from the need for two parents to raise the brood successfully 10  during courtship the pair excitedly hop around perches in trees and the male makes sharp tic notes until the female sits still the male then hops around the female between two perches usually with food in his beak 2  there has been one observation of catbirds mating in captivity which firth describes he held some food in his bill drew close to the female and stretched his head and neck up vertically to full extent while looking at her so that the somewhat erected feathers of the neck appeared sparse he directly mounted the crouching female for a few seconds and the two birds then flew together directly to the ground the male still holding the food in his bill once on the ground the male passed the food to the female who took and swallowed it both birds then flew off together 31  the breeding season is from august to march 2 spotted catbirds build a nest instead of making a bower only females build the nest nesting begins in september when rainfall and temperatures increase 10  the nest is about nine inches wided and six to eight inches deep the egg cavity in five and a half inches wide and three inches deep 21  the nest foundation is made up of sticks and twigs around a lower nest cup the bowl is composed of medium sized dry leaves leaf skeletons and vine tendrils in the bottom of the bowl decaying wood pulp is arranged with pieces of mud or clay the nest egg cup lining made of vine tendrils is placed in the bottom of the bowl 10  nests have been found built on top of old ones from years past and new nests may be built close to old ones 21  incubation of the eggs lasts an average of 22 23 days and the average nestling period is 19 20 days 10  spotted catbirds protect their nests by working together to distract any intruder when a couple of observers approached a nest both sexes became greatly agitated and the presumed male would perch close by restlessly shifting his position and singing his strange song – ‘meeyooweh’ he put a great deal of energy into these songs tossing his head back as he did so and ending each with a squeak meanwhile the other bird would perform a distraction display running along the ground rapidly with tail fanned so that the white terminal spots were prominent and making peculiar squeaking sounds 32 there are usually two but possibly three eggs which are glossy cream colored and oval in shape 21  there is some tapering slightly towards the small end and the shell is close grained and smooth 2  the eggs are laid at long intervals which has also been observed in the green catbird 33  these eggs are laid on alternate days about 48 hours apart 34  the female is the sole incubator of the eggs 2 references

carolinensis also spelled grey catbird is a medium sized north american and central american perching bird of the mimid family it is the only member of the catbird genus dumetella like the black catbird melanoptila glabrirostris it is among the basal lineages of the mimidae probably a closer relative of the caribbean thrasher and trembler assemblage than of the mockingbirds and toxostoma thrashers 2  3  in some areas it is known as the slate colored mockingbird 4 nomenclature and taxonomy edit the name dumetella is based upon the latin term dūmus thorny thicket 5  it thus means approximately small thornbush dweller or small bird of the thornbushes it refers to the species habit of singing when hidden in undergrowth the specific name carolinensis is new latin for from the carolinas 6 the species was first described by carl linnaeus in his 1766 edition of systema naturae his original name muscicapa carolinensis reflected the belief widespread at that time that the gray catbird was some sort of old world flycatcher presumably due to its remarkably plain coloration not similar to other mimids 7 the genus name has a convoluted nomenclatorial history the monotypic genus galeoscoptes proposed by jean cabanis in 1850 was widely used up to 1907 this name roughly means capped mockingbird from latin galea helmet and ancient greek skóptein σκώπτειν to scold or to mock but as it turned out dumetella was a technically acceptable senior synonym even though the peculiar circumstances of its publishing left the identity of its author unsolved until 1989 as it turned out the genus name was published by ct wood in 1837 his description is somewhat eccentric and was published under his pseudonym sdw wood misquotes his source—john lathams 1783 general synopsis of birds—as calling the bird cat thrush probably because he knew the species under that name from george shaws general zoology actually lathams name was cat flycatcher analogous to the scientific name of linné 5  7  8 shaw and subsequently ct wood used ljp vieillots specific name felivox this means cat voice a contraction of latin felis cat and vox voice vieillot differing from the earlier authors believed the bird to be a true thrush turdus 5  9 though mimids were widely considered turdidae until the 1850s this is actually not significantly more correct than treating them as old world flycatchers as these three families are actually distinct lineages of the muscicapoidea superfamily somewhat ironically in the mid 20th century the turdidae and even most of the sylvioidea were lumped in the muscicapidae—but the mimidae were notlastly the smaller gray catbirds from bermuda which have proportionally narrow and shorter rectrices and primary remiges were described as subspecies bermudianus from bermuda by outram bangs in 1901 but this taxon was never widely accepted and today the gray catbird is generally considered monotypic as a species toodescription edit adults weigh from 232 to

as those of hylidae tree frogs and even mechanical sounds because of its well developed songbird syrinx it is able to make two sounds at the same time the alarm call resembles the quiet calls of a male mallarda gray catbirds song is easily distinguished from that of the northern mockingbird mimus polyglottos or brown thrasher toxostoma rufum because the mockingbird repeats its phrases or strophes 3 to 4 times the thrasher usually twice but the catbird sings most phrases only once the catbirds song is usually described as more raspy and less musical than that of a mockingbirdin contrast to the many songbirds that choose a prominent perch from which to sing the catbird often elects to sing from inside a bush or small tree where it is obscured from view by the foliageecology and behavior edit geographical range and habitat edit native to most of temperate north america east of the rocky mountains gray catbirds migrate to the southeastern united states mexico central america and the caribbean in winter except for the occasional vagrant they always stay east of the american cordillera they are extremely rare vagrants to western europe normally present on the breeding grounds by may most leave for winter quarters in septemberoctober as it seems this species is increasingly extending its stay in the summer range with some nowadays remaining until mid winter as far north as ohio 7  12  13  the gray catbird is a migratory species spring migration ranges from march to may and in the fall ranges from late august to november 14 the catbird tends to avoid dense unbroken woodlands and does not inhabit coniferous pine woodland catbirds prefer a dense vegetative substrate especially if thorny vegetation is present 14  15  scrublands woodland edges overgrown farmland and abandoned orchards are generally among the preferred locations of the catbird in bermuda its preferred habitats are scrub and myrtle swamp 15  during the winter season the catbird has an affinity for berry rich thickets especially within proximity of water sources 14 breeding edit their breeding habitat is semi open areas with dense low growth they are also found in urban suburban and rural habitats in the winter months they actually seem to associate with humans even more 16  these birds mainly forage on the ground in leaf litter but also in shrubs and trees they mainly eat arthropods and berries in the winter months cymbopetalum mayanum annonaceae and trophis racemosa moraceae bear fruit well liked by this species and such trees can be planted to attract the gray catbird into parks and gardens 16 they build a bulky cup nest in a shrub or tree close to the ground eggs are light blue in color and clutch size ranges from 1–5 with 2–3 eggs most common both parents take turns feeding the young birdspredation and threats edit usually a shy bird it can be attracted by pishing sound 9  gray catbirds are not afraid of predators and respond to them aggressively by flashing their wings and tails and by making their signature mew sounds they are also known to even attack and peck predators that come too near their nests they also will destroy eggs of the brood parasitic brown headed cowbird molothrus ater laid in their nests by pecking itthis species is widespread and generally plentiful though its reclusive habits often make it seem less common than it actually is it is not considered threatened by the iucn due to its large range and numbers 1  9 on bermuda however gray catbirds were once very common but their numbers have been greatly reduced in recent years by deforestation and nest predation by introduced species including the great kiskadee pitangus sulphuratus and the european starling sturnus vulgaris in the united states this species receives special legal protections under the migratory bird treaty act of 1918references edit  a b birdlife international 2012 dumetella carolinensis iucn red list of threatened

yellow breasted chat   wikipedia icteria redirects here for the yellowing of the skin and eyes icterus or icteric see jaundicethe yellow breasted chat icteria virens is a large songbird widely considered the most atypical member of the new world warbler family though the long standing suspicion is that it does not actually belong there its placement is not definitely resolved it is the only member of the genus icteriadistribution and habitat edit found throughout north america from southern plains of canada to central mexico during the summer these birds mainly migrate to mexico and central america although some of their number may overwinter in coastal areas this species occurs in areas where dense shrubby growth is common today its habitat often consists of abandoned farmland and other rural areas where overgrown vegetation proliferatesdescription edit if they are considered part of the family parulidae new world warblers yellow breasted chats are the largest species of parulid in fact they can often weigh more than twice as much as other parulid species however their membership in this taxonomic family is disputedthis species reaches a total length of 17 to 191 cm 67 to 75 in and a wingspan of 23 to 27 cm 91 to 106 in body mass can range from 202 to 338 g 071 to 119 oz among standard measurements the wing chord is 71 to 84 cm 28 to 33 in the elongated tail is 69 to 86 cm 27 to 34 in the relatively long heavy bill is 13 to 16 cm 051 to 063 in and the tarsus is 25 to 31 cm 098 to 122 in 2  these birds have olive upperparts with white bellies and bright yellow throats and breasts other signature features of yellow breasted chats are its large white eye rings and blackish legs if seen this species is unlikely to be mistaken for any other birdbiology edit the yellow breasted chat is a shy skulking species of bird often being only heard but not seen the breeding habitats of this species are dense brushy areas and hedgerows the nests of these birds are bulky cups made of grasses leaves strips of bark stems of weeds and lined with finer grasses wiry plant stems pine needles and sometimes roots and hair nests are invariably placed in thick shrubs and often only about 25 m 82 ft above the ground they will lay from 3 to 5 creamy white eggs with reddish brown blotches or speckles incubated by the female hatch in 11 to 12 days both parents tend the young who fledge in approximately 8 to 11 days chats are apparently vigilant guards of their nests as parasitism by brown headed cowbirds is not as frequent as with other cup nest builders 3  however they are not as monogamous as other warblers in one study in central kentucky dna fingerprinting revealed that 17 of 29 yellow breasted chat nestlings were not sired by the male of the social pair and 33 of 9 broods contained at least 1 extra pair nestlingyellow breasted chats are ominvorous birds and forage in dense vegetation mostly this species feeds on insects and berries including blackberries and wild grapes insects of up to moderate sizes including grasshoppers bugs beetles weevils bees wasps tent caterpillars ants moths and mayflies are typically predated and will be gleaned from dense vegetation 3  other invertebrates including spiders are occasionally eaten as well uniquely for a passerine of its size the chat occasionally grips food with its feet before it eatsthe song of this bird is an odd variable mixture of cackles clucks whistles and hoots their calls are harsh chaks unlike most warblers this species has been known to mimic the calls of other birds thus less experienced field birdwatchers sometimes overlook chats after mistaking their song for species such as gray catbirds and brown thrashers which share similar habitat preferences and skulking habits though are generally much more abundant during the breeding season chats are at their most conspicuous as they will usually sing from exposed locations and even fly in the open while gurgling their songs 4 yellow breasted chats are declining in eastern north america due to habitat loss which is caused primarily from deforestation and urban development this species though less vulnerable than other cup nesters is still sometimes victim to brood parasitism from brown headed cowbirds that have taken advantage of the fragmentation of eastern forests to expand their range in the last century however the species still occurs over a wide range and is considered to be of least concern 5 references edit external links edit 
eastern towhee   wikipedia the eastern towhee pipilo erythrophthalmus is a large new world sparrow the taxonomy of the towhees has been under debate in recent decades and formerly this bird and the spotted towhee were considered a single species the rufous sided towheetheir breeding habitat is brushy areas across eastern north america they nest either low in bushes or on the ground under shrubs northern birds migrate to the southern united states there has been one record of this species as a vagrant to western europe a single bird in great britain in 1966the song is a short drink your teeeeea lasting around one second starting with a sharp call drink and ending with a short trill teeeeea the name towhee is onomatopoeic description of one of the towhees most common calls a short two part call rising in pitch and sometimes also called a chewink call 2 description edit the eastern towhee is a large and striking species of sparrow the total length ranges from 173 to 23 cm 68 to 91 in and the wingspan is 20–30 cm 79–118 in 3  4  the body of mass of this species ranges from 32 to 53 g 11 to 19 oz with an average of 40 g 14 oz 5  adults have rufous sides a white belly and a long dark tail with white edges the eyes are red white for birds in the southeast males have a black head upper body and tail these parts are brown in the female juveniles are brown overall eastern towhees of all ages and both sexes generally are unmistakable and are not known to co exist with the similar western spotted towheedistribution edit the eastern towhee occurs throughout the eastern united states and southeast canada occurrences from southern saskatchewan southwest ontario and quebec south to florida and west to eastern texas are noted in a literature review populations north of southern new england through northern indiana and illinois to southern iowa primarily are summer residents 2 pipilo e erythrophthalmus occurs in the most northerly part of the eastern towhees distribution in the summer and in winter migrates to the southern and eastern portion of the range of the species the other subspecies are largely residents 6  pipilo e canaster occurs from south central louisiana north to northeastern louisiana east through mississippi extreme southwestern tennessee northern alabama and georgia central south carolina to western north carolina and south to northwestern florida and east along the gulf coast 7  the range of p e rileyi extends from northern florida through southern georgia and coastal south carolina to east central north carolina pipilo e alleni occurs in peninsular florida 6 the eastern towhee occurs in vegetation of disturbed areas such as old field successional vegetation and shrubby areas of power line right of ways in northwestern arkansas eastern towhees occurred in old field vegetation where dwarf sumac rhus copallina occurred at a frequency of 286 winged elm ulmus alata at a frequency of 21 and black cherry prunus serotina at a frequency of 192 8  shrubby vegetation along power lines commonly is used by eastern towhees 9  for example in maryland eastern towhee territories along a power line right of way corresponded with shrubby areas containing species such as allegheny blackberry rubus allegheniensis and blueberry vaccinium spp other species included hawthorn crataegus spp red maple acer rubrum black cherry and black locust robinia pseudoacacia 9 timing of major life events edit arrival and departure of eastern towhees into summer breeding grounds varies with location according to a literature review eastern towhees typically arrive in new york in early april and leave by the middle of november a review of eastern towhees in new hampshire describes arrival in late april to may with the majority departing in september 10  further south on the border of tennessee and north carolina migration to high elevation areas within the great smoky mountains begins as early as march eastern towhees typically leave these sites in october 11  the pipilo e erythrophthalmus subspecies is the most migratory of the subspecies 6 breeding begins in spring and continues to late summer reports of eastern towhees nesting as early as late march in florida and georgia in mid  to late april in some midwestern states and as late as mid may in northern new england were summarized in a literature review 2  literature reviews also report nest construction by the female which takes about three to five days 2  10  egg laying typically occurs until august for example a review of eastern towhees in indiana notes nesting from 15 april to 20 august 12  however a literature review of eastern towhees in florida included a report of a nest observed on 2 september 1983 that contained two eggs 13  according to several literature reviews eastern towhees may renest after failed nesting attempts and can raise two and in the south sometimes three broods per season 2  10  13 in a literature review greenlaw  2  reports mean breeding territory size of 4 acres 16 ha range 16–6 acres 064–244 ha n24 in a mesic oak quercus species forest where eastern towhees occurred at a density of 21 males40 ha in a xeric pine pinus species oak woodland where the eastern towhee density was 32 males40 ha mean eastern towhee territory size was 3 acres 12 ha range 18–4 acres 071–165 ha n20 2  in massachusetts mean male eastern towhee territory size was about 13 acres 052 ha and female eastern towhee territory size was 11 acres 045 ha territory size changed over the course of the breeding season and was not significantly pgt005 affected by reductions in food availability of 30 or less during the winter eastern towhees are not as territorial and may be seen in mixed species flocks 2  daily movement of eastern towhees in loblolly p taeda and longleaf pine p palustris forests and clearcuts in south carolina averaged 325 feet 99 m per day only 2 females out of 11 females and 9 males stayed within the stand where they were captured for the duration of a 10 week study 14 eastern towhees have fairly strong fidelity to breeding territories in an oak forest in new jersey adult eastern towhee return rates were 20 the 1st year after banding and 43 in subsequent years between 1960 and 1967 the maximum number of eastern towhee returns to the site was 5 15  in a pennsylvania woodlot observed between 1962 and 1967 an eastern towhee returned to the site for 4 consecutive years 16 several reviews report eastern towhee clutch sizes from 2 to 6 eggs with means ranging from 245 to 36 eggs per nest 2  10  12  13  all 5 eastern towhee nests on sanibel island florida contained 3 eggs 17  eastern towhees in 2 pitch pine p rigida barrens sites in new jersey and new york had a later median egg laying date mid june and significantly plt005 smaller average early nest clutch sizes nj267 ny325 than those in an oak hickory carya spp site which had a median egg laying date in early june and an average early nest clutch size of 388 food availability likely explains at least some of the differences between the 2 habitat types eggs are incubated by the female for 12 or 13 days after hatching both parents feed the young which fledge 10 to 12 days later and are dependent on parental care for about another month 2  10  12  13 a wide range of eastern towhee nest success values have been reported on sanibel island 1 of the 5 eastern towhee nests observed was successful in louisiana average daily nest success rate was 953 on a bottomland hardwood forest site the same study found a 926 average daily nest success rate in a 6 year old managed cottonwood populus spp plantation in alabama average eastern towhee nest success across mixed bigtooth p grandidentata and quaking aspen p tremuloides stands of varying ages in pennsylvania was 481 18  in south carolina only 1 of 10 nests was successful and the mean daily nest survival rate was 629 this low value was explained by high levels of predation due to lower nest success rates of bachmans sparrow aimophila aestivalis than the previous year it is suggested that eastern towhee nest success may have been measured during a comparatively poor year 14 compared to nests adult towhee survival rates are high average weekly adult survival rate of eastern towhees in a south carolina study area was 993 this rate was obtained from radio marked eastern towhees and represented the pooled survival of both sexes and from 2 south carolina sites young and mature stands of loblolly and longleaf pine 14  between 1962 and 1967 in pennsylvania annual survival of breeding eastern towhees calculated from mistnetting recaptures was 58 16  according to a literature review both males and females become reproductively mature in their second year 2  eastern towhees of over 12 years old have been reported in the wild 19 preferred habitat edit eastern towhees range from near sea level to as high as 6500 ft 2000 m along the border of tennessee and north carolina during the summer 11  a literature review reports eastern towhees up to 3000 ft 910 m in new hampshire 10 eastern towhees spend the majority of their time near the ground for instance in pennsylvania in spring observations of eastern towhees below 3 ft 091 m from the ground occurred significantly plt005 more than expected based on random spatial distribution and observations above 3 ft 091 m occurred significantly plt005 less than would be expected 20  in a louisiana bottomland forest 62 of eastern towhee observations were within 2 ft 061 m of the ground and only 4 were observed above 25 ft 76 m in the spring this changed with detections of eastern towhees below 25 ft 76 m declining from 70 to 65 and detections in the canopy gt25 ft gt76 m increasing from 4 to 7 21 eastern towhees occur in many habitats from tallgrass prairies and marshes to mature forests 14  however eastern towhees are most common in early successional stands habitat edges and areas with similar vegetation structure throughout eastern forestsin most communities eastern towhees are more abundant in young successional stands several studies found increased eastern towhee abundance on early successional sites compared to later successional sites 20  22  23  24  mean number of breeding eastern towhees 070 bird50 m radius and nest success rate 58 were higher in a 15 year old clearcut in west virginia than in other treatments including a stand of yellow poplar liriodendron tulipifera black cherry red maple sugar maple acer saccharum and white ash fraxinus americana that was not harvested 22  in a southern missouri oak hickory forest eastern towhees were not present before clearcutting or in the nearby uncut forest after cutting but occurred at a mean density of 93 birds10 ha in a 3 year old clearcut a study of stands of varying ages in central new york found that eastern towhee density peaked in early successional stands 23 although eastern towhees generally prefer young successional sites variation between habitat types and years has been observed krementz and powell  14  found higher relative abundance of eastern towhee in young 2–6 years old stands of loblolly and longleaf pine than mature 32–98 years old stands when investigated in 1995 however in stands compared in 1996 the 95 confidence intervals of eastern towhee relative abundance on the 2 sites had a substantial degree of overlap the degree to which eastern towhee responds to succession is influenced by habitat for example in pennsylvania there was a significant plt005 difference between eastern towhee densities number10 ha between mature mixed oak forest and stands that had been clearcut about 5 years previously however eastern towhee densities did not differ significantly between a 1 year old mixed aspen populus tremuloides p grandidentata clearcut a 5 year old aspen clearcut and a mature aspen stand 25  eastern towhee abundance has been shown to peak at different times in different habitats for instance although in central hardwood forests eastern towhees were most abundant in regenerating stands in loblolly and shortleaf pine forest they were most common in pole timber and mature stands in addition bell and whitmore concluded that early successional is likely too broad of a term for describing optimal towhee habitat since high density of small trees was negatively associated with eastern towhee density in the eastern panhandle of west virginia 26 eastern towhees seem to prefer sites with characteristics generally associated with early successional vegetation such as low canopy cover and dense understory negative correlations between eastern towhee abundance and various measurements of overstory density have been found in several studies 8  25  average density of eastern towhees across 6 habitat types in pennsylvania was significantly plt005 negatively correlated with density of overstory trees and basal area of overstory trees 25  number of eastern towhees in a western virginia hardwood forest was also significantly plt005 inversely correlated with total percent canopy cover in a loblolly pine forest in south carolina the average number of eastern towhee breeding territories per experimental unit was significantly p≤0008 negatively correlated with mid story 10–46 ft 30–140 m pine pinus spp and deciduous volume 27 many studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between eastern towhee abundance and understory density in a loblolly pine forest in south carolina understory 0–10 ft 0–3 m pine volume was significantly plt0001 positively correlated with the average number of eastern towhee territories per experimental unit 27  yahner  25  found the average density of eastern towhees over 6 habitat types was significantly plt005 positively correlated with density of short 2–5 foot 05–15 m shrubs in east central florida slash pine p elliottii flatwoods with understories dominated by myrtle oak q myrtifolia and sand live oak q geminata and in scrub sites with scattered slash pine and cabbage palmetto sabal palmetto eastern towhee densities were significantly p001 negatively correlated with mean shrub height 28 eastern towhees may associate with and avoid certain plants in nevada towhees seem to prefer a habitat in which they are camouflaged such as flowering quince which matches their rufous coloration in riparian vegetation in iowa eastern towhee density was significantly p≤001 positively associated with total plant and vine species richness and negatively correlated with forb and deciduous tree species richness 29  in west virginia eastern towhees were associated with plant species that occurred on drier ridgetops such as blackberry plt002 black cherry plt0002 and black locust plt004 these sites tended to have open canopies and low tree density eastern towhee density was negatively associated with plants of the moister parts of this study area such as black tupelo nyssa sylvatica plt0006 red maple plt0001 and witch hazel plt003 26  in central new jersey eastern towhees were significantly p003 more abundant in gray dogwood cornus racemosa shrubland than either eastern redcedar juniperus virginiana or multiflora rose rosa multiflora shrublands 30 nesting habitat eastern towhees typically nest on or near the ground several literature reviews note the predominance of eastern towhee nests below 5 feet 15 m 2  10  12  13  in a study of cowbird parasitism on sanibel island all 5 eastern towhee nests located were within 6 feet 2 m of the ground 17  nests as high as 18 feet 55 m have been reported in literature reviews 2  10  12  nests higher off the ground in mixed aspen stands of varying ages in pennsylvania had significantly plt0001 lower nest success of 13 unsuccessful eastern towhee nests 11 were greater than 1 foot 05 m above the ground 18 in west virginia there were no significant pgt005 differences in habitat surrounding successful and unsuccessful nests large snags ≥9 inches diameter at breast height ≥229 cm did not have an effect on nesting success 31  nesting success was not significantly pgt005 affected by stand age or distance to edge in even aged mixed aspen stands in pennsylvania 18 eastern towhees nest in a variety of species including grape and blueberry vaccinium spp the majority of nests observed in south carolina loblolly and longleaf pine forests and clearcuts were located in grape tree sparkleberry v arboreum and oak quercus spp 14  on an oak hickory site in west virginia 27 of 41 eastern towhee nests were found in grape 17 in blackberry rubus spp 12 in greenbrier smilax spp and 12 in mountain laurel kalmia latifolia nests also occurred in virginia creeper parthenocissus quinquefolia spice bush lindera benzoin and azalea rhododendron spp 31  in a power line right of way in pennsylvania the 6 eastern towhee nests observed occurred in allegheny blackberry witch hazel hamamelis virginiana blueberry vaccinium spp white oak q alba eastern hayscented fern dennstaedtia punctilobula and sweetfern comptonia peregrina combined and on ground level according to literature reviews eastern towhee nests located on the ground are embedded in litter in dry areas and typically occur at the base of grasses forbs low shrubs or small trees 2  12 foraging habitat selection of foraging habitat by eastern towhees has been investigated in massachusetts and new jersey when gleaning in a southeastern massachusetts pitch pine barren eastern towhees preferred species such as pitch pine bear oak q ilicifolia and other deciduous trees mainly oaks ericaceous species were avoided use differed significantly plt0001 from availability 32  on 2 new jersey sites eastern towhee foraging preference switched over the course of the breeding season 33  on a site dominated by oaks primarily black oak q velutina eastern towhees used oaks in may as would be expected due to their density however in june and july as relative arthropod biomass declined in oaks use of oaks was less than would be expected on a pitch pine dominated site use of oaks primarily bear oak and blackjack oak q marilandica was greater than would be expected in may but was proportionate to availability in june and july these negative correlations between date and oak use were significant plt0025 for both sites use of the oak dominated site also decreased significantly plt005 through the summer 33 effects of spatial area eastern towhees appear to prefer edge habitats in many areas for instance the mean abundance of eastern towhees in a baldcypress taxodium distichum in northern florida was 18 while eastern towhees did not occur in either the baldcypress forest or the clearcut at the interface of the baldcypress stand and a 13 year old planted slash pine stand mean abundance of eastern towhees was 22 breeding birds while in the planted slash pine stand the average abundance was 15 breeding birds density of eastern towhees was found to decline with distance from the edge of a power line right of way and an oak hickory forest in eastern tennessee at the edge eastern towhees occurred at a density of just over 10 pairs40 ha while 197 feet 60 m from the edge eastern towhee density had dropped to 1 pair40 ha 34  in addition in experimentally clearcut pennsylvanian forests composed of white oak northern red oak q rubra chestnut oak q prinus scarlet oak q coccinea red maple quaking aspen bigtooth aspen and pitch pine male towhees were detected significantly plt005 more often than expected in the areas where the spatial arrangement of clearcuts was most patchy 35 several studies have addressed the effect of the size of habitat patches on eastern towhees in mixed oak forest in new jersey eastern towhee frequency generally increased with patch size although eastern towhees were detected in all plot sizes 05–59 acres 02–24 ha except 002–acre 001 ha plots on a site in south carolina eastern towhee frequency of occurrence increased as clearcut size increased from lt25 acres lt1 ha to clearcut sizes from 21 to about 32 acres 85–128 ha on another site eastern towhee frequency declined as clearcut size increased from 19 to 33 acres 76–132 ha to 48 to 62 acres 195–252 ha 24  eastern towhees only bred in riparian vegetation patches in iowa that were at least 650 feet 200 m wide 29  in southern and eastern pennsylvania eastern towhee nest success was not significantly p≥010 different on sites with gradual edges and those with more distinct edges between wildlife habitat openings and oak hickory forest 36 food habits edit eastern towhees primarily eat on the ground although they also glean from vegetation in a southeastern massachusetts pitch pine barren 735 of male and 804 of female foraging observations were on the ground 32  when foraging on the ground eastern towhees use a scratching technique where both feet kick back simultaneously 13  in a laboratory study 4 eastern towhees used this method to successfully obtain seed buried almost 1 inch 225 cm deep when foraging above ground the majority of time is spent gleaning foliage 32  in massachusetts 225 of male and 163 of female foraging observations were of food being gleaned from foliage eastern towhees were also observed gleaning from twigs branches and trunks when gleaning eastern towhees occurred significantly plt001 more often on the distal half of tree branches compared to using distal and proximal portions equally in 05 of male and 03 of female foraging observations eastern towhees hovered eastern towhees were never observed catching food out of the air 32 eastern towhees eat a variety of plant and animal matter in literature reviews eastern towhees are reported to eat seeds and fruits several invertebrates and occasionally small amphibians snakes and lizards 13  reviews report eastern towhees foraging at feeders 2  reviews show that animal matter makes up a larger proportion of the diet in the breeding season 2  37  in fall and winter plants make up 79 and 85 of the diet respectively this drops to 53 in spring and 43 in summer 37  insects such as beetles coleoptera grasshoppers and crickets orthoptera ants wasps and bees hymenoptera and moths and caterpillars lepidoptera are common prey items eastern towhees eat other invertebrates such as spiders araneae millipedes diplopoda centipedes chilopoda and snails gastropoda to a lesser extent 2  37  plants that comprise at least 5 of the eastern towhee diet include ragweed ambrosia spp oak smartweed polygonum spp and corn zea mays in the northeast and blackberry oak panicgrass panicum spp ragweed and wax myrtle morella cerifera in the southeast 37 predators edit many animals prey on eastern towhees and their eggs including reptiles mammals and birds a literature review summarizes several reports demonstrating that predators are a major cause of nest failure 2  the highest nest predation rate noted was 88 in a new york study mammals that are likely nest predators include northern raccoons procyon lotor domestic cats felis catus and eastern chipmunks tamias striatus snakes such as bullsnakes pituophis catenifer rat snakes elaphe spp and garter snakes thamnophis spp have been reported eating eastern towhee eggs weasels mustela spp and blue jays cyanocitta cristata are also likely nest predators 2  several birds are known to prey on both young and adult eastern towhees including northern goshawk accipiter gentilis broad winged buteo platypterus short tailed buteo brachyurus sharp shinned accipiter striatus and coopers hawks accipiter cooperii other predators include barred strix varia short eared asio flammeus and eastern screech owls megascops asio and even the loggerhead shrike lanius ludovicianus

brandts cormorant   wikipedia the brandts cormorant phalacrocorax penicillatus is a strictly marine bird of the cormorant family of seabirds that inhabits the pacific coast of north america it ranges in the summer from alaska to the gulf of california but the population north of vancouver island migrates south during the winter its specific name penicillatus is latin for a painters brush pencil of hairs in reference to white plumes on its neck and back during the early breeding season the common name honors the german naturalist johann friedrich von brandt of the academy of sciences at st petersburg who described the species from specimens collected on expeditions to the pacific during the early 19th centurybrandts cormorants feed either singly or in flocks and are adaptable in prey choice and undersea habitat it feeds on small fish from the surface to sea floor obtaining them like all cormorants by pursuit diving using its feet for propulsion prey is often what is most common in central california rockfish from the genus sebastes is the most commonly taken but off british columbia it is pacific herring brandts cormorants have been observed foraging at depths of over 120 feetduring the breeding season adults have a blue throat patch this species nests on the ground or on rocky outcroppingsadult showing blue throat patch characteristic of breeding plumagereferences edit external links edit 
red faced cormorant   wikipedia the red faced cormorant red faced shag or violet shag phalacrocorax urile is a species of cormorant that is found in the far north of the pacific ocean and bering sea from the eastern tip of hokkaidō in japan via the kuril islands the southern tip of the kamchatka peninsula and the aleutian islands to the alaska peninsula and gulf of alaska the red faced cormorant is closely related to the pelagic cormorant p pelagicus which has a similar range and like the pelagic cormorant is placed by some authors eg johnsgaard in a genus leucocarbo where it nests alongside the pelagic cormorant the red faced cormorant generally breeds the more successfully of the two species and it is currently increasing in numbers at least in the easterly parts of its range it is however listed as being of conservation concern verification needed  partly because relatively little is so far known about itthe adult bird has glossy plumage that is a deep greenish blue in color becoming purplish or bronze on the back and sides in breeding condition it has a double crest and white plumes on the flanks neck and rump and the bare facial skin of the lores and around the eyes is a bright orange or red giving the bird its name although the coloration is less vivid outside the breeding season the red facial skin is enough to distinguish it from the otherwise rather similar pelagic cormorant its legs and feet are brownish black its wings range from 25 to 29 cm in extent with females having on average about 5 cm shorter wings adults weigh between 15 and 23 kg with females averaging 350 g less than malesanalysis of stomach contents suggests that the red faced cormorant is mainly a bottom feeder taking cottids especially adults have few predators though river otters may attempt to take them as will corvids of various species bald eagles and golden eagles gulls and corvids are common predators on eggs and chicksreferences edit johnsgaard p a 1993 cormorants darters and pelicans of the world washington dc smithsonian institution press
pelagic cormorant   wikipedia the pelagic cormorant phalacrocorax pelagicus also known as bairds cormorant is a small member of the cormorant family phalacrocoracidae analogous to other smallish cormorants it is also called the pelagic shag occasionally this seabird lives along the coasts of the northern pacific during winter it can also be found in the open ocean 2  pelagic cormorants have relatively short wings due to their need for economical movement underwater and consequently have the highest flight costs of any bird 3 many authors favor splitting up the wastebin genus phalacrocorax in this case the pelagic cormorant would probably be placed in compsohalieus 4 description edit this is a smallish cormorant which measures 25 to 35 in 64 to 89 cm in length with a wingspan of about 33 ft 1 meter and a weight of 52–86 oz 1474–2438 g when fully grown adults in nonbreeding plumage are all black with a metallic iridescence in breeding plumage they grow two short crests one on top of the head and one at the nape white thighs and scattered white filoplumes on the head and neck the long thin bill and the large feet with all webbed toes are black throughout the year while the patch of dark naked skin below the eye turns a vivid magenta in the breeding season 2 males and females do not differ in appearance though the latter are a bit smaller immature birds lack iridescence and are dark brown grading into slightly lighter brown on the underside 2 the widely sympatric red faced cormorant p urile looks very similar breeding adults are easily told apart by the amount of naked facial skin which does not noticeably extend beyond the eye in p pelagicus but extends to above the bill and above and behind the eye in p urile the latter species also has larger crests juveniles and nonbreeding adults of the two species are often indistinguishable even to trained observers when in mixed flocks or if they cannot be observed up close in the former case the large naked face mask and light bill of p urile can be easily recognized in the latter case its larger size though male pelagic cormorants can be as large as female red faced cormorants unlike the red faced cormorant the present species usually calls out before taking off particularly during the breeding season in courtship display nest material is typically torn and moved about which p urile might not do and the males apparently do not bow their heads before the females as p urile males do other north pacific cormorants and shags are larger with a thicker bill andor lack the white thighs in breeding plumage 5 range and ecology edit the pelagic cormorant inhabits the shores and the neritic zone of the north pacific its north american range extends from alaska to the baja california peninsula in mexico it furthermore is found on the aleutian and other bering strait islands and from the russian far east chukchi peninsula via sakhalin south to kamchatka and ultimately kyūshū though not the rest of japan the subarctic populations are migratory while the birds from temperate and subtropical regions only disperse locally after breeding but even so asian birds may reach china or korea vagrants have been recorded in the hawaiian islands 2 on land pelagic cormorants are rather clumsy and walk with the high stepped waddling gait typical for all sulae except darters after landing they often scratch the ground as is typical for cormorants when they feel threatened they will dart their bills at the intruder and shake their heads and make a gargling noise this bird forages by swimming to locate prey then diving and going after it underwater propelled by its feet and steering with the wings it can dive as deep as 100 ft 30 m to feed on or near the seafloor typical hunting grounds are sheltered inlets and bays especially outside the breeding season they can also be seen fishing out at sea they prefer to hunt in the vicinity of kelp beds or among rocks typical prey are smallish bottom living non schooling fishes such as ammodytes sand eels sculpins cottidae gunnels pholidae and sebastes rockfish apart from fish small crustaceans – in particular shrimp – are also often eaten it has been observed to join mixed species feeding flocks going after schools of young pacific herrings clupea pallasii like all cormorants due to their vestigial uropygial gland their plumage is not waterproof thus the birds return to a safe place after foraging to preen and dry their feathers typically adopting a spread winged posture 6 a parent with approximately one month old chicks on a nestthe pelagic cormorant breeds on rocky shores and islands they do not form large colonies but smaller groups may nest together in some cases these birds alternate between two or three nesting sites in a region from one year to another the nest is built at the cliff face usually on ledges less often in crevices or caves the nest is built from stringy plants such as grasses or seaweed and held together by the birds own guano once the birds have found a nest site they like they tend to remain faithful to it for the rest of their lives the nest is repaired and improved in each season if need be it can thus grow up to 5 ft 15 m deep 2 males searching for a mate or bonding with their partner give an elaborate courtship display as is typical for sulae like all cormorants this includes stretching the gular sac with the hyoid bone and repeated yawning as in many but not all cormorants the pelagic cormorants display furthermore includes arching the neck and hopping lifting the folded wings and rapidly fluttering them to show the white thigh patches during the yawning display the head is thrown back and calls are given which differ between males and females when the birds land males and females give an identical call otherwise the displays are given in silence 7 the clutch is generally between two and five eggs most often three or four but clutches of up to seven eggs have been recorded incubation lasts for 3 weeks verification needed  to one month at hatching the young weigh somewhat more than an ounce 35 g and are naked but they soon grow sooty gray down feathers in normal years all young of a typical clutch may be raised successfully but less than four rarely fledge on the other hand during unfavorable phases of the pacific decadal oscillation most pairs manage to raise only two young at most they reach sexual maturity at two years of age and a maximum age of almost eighteen years has been recorded in the wild 8 this numerous and widespread species is not considered threatened by the iucn the bulk of its population is found in the relatively inaccessible waters of the bering sea region about 50000 each breed in the kuril islands the bering sea islands and the us state of alaska and its offshore islands including the aleuts about 25000 breed down the pacific coast of north america some 60 of which are found in california local populations may be all but wiped out temporarily by oil spills and on a larger scale competition with gillnet fisheries and drowning in such nets is putting a limit to its stocks 2 the acanthocephalan parasite andracantha phalacrocoracis was described from this cormorant 9 taxonomy and systematics edit the cormorant family phalacrocoracidae has traditionally been included – like all other birds with fully webbed toes – in the pelecaniformes but the namesake pelicans pelecanidae are actually closer relatives of storks ciconiidae than of cormorants hence it has been proposed to separate the phalacrocoracidae and relatives as order phalacrocoraciformes 10 this species is here placed in the catch all genus phalacrocorax modern authors generally are reserved about uniting all cormorants in one wastebin genus but no general revision has been published that has any phylogenetic merit though it was proposed to place the pelagic cormorant in stictocarbo for example this is quite certainly wrong as the present species is by no means closely related to the spotted shag p punctatus the type species of stictocarbo similarly leucocarbo would refer to the group around the imperial shag p atriceps complex which occurs on the opposite end of the earth from p pelagicus the supposed cliff shag subfamily leucocarboninae is entirely paraphyletic cannot be accepted as originally circumscribed if subfamilies are to be accepted in the phalacrocoracidae the pelagic shag and its relatives would go in the phalacrocoracinae like most northern hemisphere cormorants and shags while leucocarboninae would include mainly southern hemisphere taxa 11 in fact the correct genus name for the pelagic cormorant if phalacrocorax is to be split up would be compsohalieus this name would apply to the group around its type species brandts cormorant p penicillatus this is a north pacific clade which apart from brandts and the pelagic cormorant also includes the red faced cormorant p urile and probably also the extinct spectacled cormorant p perspicillatus they all have black feet and in breeding plumage grow white filoplumes on the head andor neck and usually also two head crests and white thigh patches like the present species does they also share the back thrown head during the yawning and the rapid wing flutter in courtship display among the compsohalieus group the red faced cormorant is the sister species of p pelagicus apart from looking almost alike these two species also yawn many times in a row instead of giving the display just once twist their bodies before taking flight during courtship and the male and female post landing calls are identical the point and gargle response to threats is also an apomorphy of these two species 12 its traditional scientific name is the literal latinized ancient greek equivalent of the common name phalacrocorax is an ancient term for cormorants literally it means bald raven from falakrós φᾶλακρός bald  kórax 13  κόραξ raven pelagicus is – like the english loanword pelagic – derived from pelágios πελᾶγιος of the open seas compsohalieus meanwhile means sleek fisher it derives from kompsós κομψός elegant or sleek  halieus 14  ἇλιεύς fisherman 15 subspecies edit two subspecies are generally recognized the difference between them is slight and generally agrees with bergmanns rule 2 phalacrocorax pelagicus pelagicus pallas 1811 – northern pelagic cormorant northwest pacific east to south alaska the larger subspecies but see belowphalacrocorax pelagicus resplendens audubon 1838 – southern pelagic cormorant british columbia to northwest mexico the smaller subspeciesthe amchitka cormorant or kenyons shag p kenyoni is a supposed species that was presumed to be closely related to the pelagic cormorant it was described from the bones of three individuals snared in fishing nets in the late 1950s at constantine harbor on amchitka in the aleutian islands the specific name kenyoni honors usfws biologist karl w kenyon who collected the type specimen usnm 431164 on 22 february 1959 some bones from prehistoric middens on amchitka were also attributed to this taxon as distinctive cormorants were never seen alive in recent years on amchitka it was conjectured by some that kenyons shag might have gone extinct in the 1960s–1970s marine pollution and overfishing would be possible reasons 16 however a subsequent analysis of a larger number of comparison specimens of the pelagic cormorant – mainly from birds that fell victim to the exxon valdez oil spill – determined that the bones were attributable to small females of the latter species and that their apparent distinctness was due to the original canonical analysis being distorted by insufficient specimens the researchers also found that contrary to what was generally assumed pelagic cormorants from the aleutians were generally small birds – as opposed to western alaskan individuals which are usually very large if the aleutian population were to be considered a distinct subspecies the name kenyoni would apply verification of subspecies status would require dna sequence analyses however since the differences in morphology are not large and there is much variation between individuals 17 in 2003 during an usfws survey three small pelagic cormorants whose bills appeared to be red were noted at karab cove on agattu island it may be that these were kenyoni but whether the bill color distinguishes the presumed subspecies or whether it is due to a simple mutation has not been determined the large birds from the prince william sound region were formerly called p p robustus but are not considered distinct today since there appear to be at least two recognizable and allopatric size groups in the northern subspecies alone more research is clearly necessary 18  birdlife international 2012 phalacrocorax pelagicus iucn red list of threatened species version 20132 international union for conservation of nature

shiny cowbird   wikipedia the shiny cowbird molothrus bonariensis is a passerine bird in the new world family icteridae it breeds in most of south america apart from the most dense jungles mountains and deserts although spreading into these habitats as they are modified by humans the coldest southernmost regions eg tierra del fuego and on trinidad and tobago it has relatively recently colonised chile and many caribbean islands and has reached the united states where it is probably breeding in southern florida northern and southernmost populations are partially migratory it is a bird associated with open woodland and cultivation the male’s song is a purr and whistle purr purr purrte tseeeee the male’s call is a sharp whistled tsee tsee but the female makes a harsh rattlelike most other cowbirds it is an obligate brood parasite laying its eggs in the nests of many other bird species such as in brazil the rufous collared sparrow and the masked water tyrant the eggs are of two types either whitish and unspotted or pale blue or green with dark spots and blotches the host’s eggs are sometimes removed and if food is short their chicks may starve but larger host species are less affected the incubation period of 11–12 days is shorter than that of most hosts extermination of the shiny cowbird within the tiny range of the pale headed brush finch has resulted in a population increase in this critically endangered speciesthe male shiny cowbird is all black with an iridescent purple blue gloss the smaller female is dark brown in plumage paler on the underparts she can be distinguished from the female brown headed cowbird by her longer finer bill pale supercilium and stronger face pattern there is an all black plumage variation and the northern subspecies m b cabanisii of panama and northern colombia is paler than the nominate m b bonariensis juveniles are like the female but more streaked below there is some variation in size across the range with the race of m b minimus from northern south america and the west indies being the smallest at 31 to 40 g 11 to 14 oz and 18 cm 71 in in length and m b cabanisii being the largest at 55 to 65 g 19 to 23 oz and 22 cm 87 in on average 2 this abundant and gregarious bird feeds mainly on insects and some seeds including rice and forages on the ground or perches on cattlereferences edit further reading edit

american crow   wikipedia the american crow corvus brachyrhynchos is a large passerine bird species of the family corvidae it is a common bird found throughout much of north america american crows are the new world counterpart to the carrion crow and the hooded crow although the american crow and the hooded crow are very similar in size structure and behavior their calls are different the american crow nevertheless occupies the same role the hooded crow does in eurasiafrom beak to tail an american crows measures 40–50 cm 16–20 in almost half of which is tail mass varies from about 300 to 600 g 10 to 20 oz males tend to be larger than females the most usual call is caaw caaw caawthe american crow is all black with iridescent feathers it looks much like other all black corvids they can be distinguished from the common raven c corax because american crows are smaller and from the fish crow c ossifragus because american crows do not hunch and fluff their throat feathers when they callamerican crows are common widespread and susceptible to the west nile virus making them useful as a bioindicator to track the viruss spread direct transmission of the virus from american crows to humans is unheard of and unlikelytaxonomy edit the american crow was described by christian ludwig brehm in 1822 2  its scientific name means literally short billed crow from ancient greek brachy  βραχυ  short  and rhynchos ρυνχος billed 3 the northwestern crow c caurinus is very closely related to the american crow its ancestors became separated by ice age glaciation west of the rocky mountains it is endemic to pacific temperate rain forests where it all but replaces the american crow only in the seattle region do they co occur to any extent in form the two species are much alike there is a marked difference in voice 4 subspecies edit four subspecies are recognized they differ in bill proportion and form a rough ne sw clinal in size across north america birds are smallest in the far west and on the south coast 5 corvus brachyrhynchos brachyrhynchos – eastern crow northeastern united states eastern canada and surroundings largest subspeciescorvus brachyrhynchos hesperis – western crow western north america except arctic north pacific northwest and extreme south smaller overall with a proportionally more slender bill 6  and low pitched voicecorvus brachyrhynchos pascuus – florida crow florida mid sized short winged but decidedly long bill and legs 6 corvus brachyrhynchos paulus – southern crow southern united states smaller overall bill also small 7 description edit an american crow making its distinctive callthe skull of an american crowthe american crow is a distinctive bird with iridescent black feathers all over its legs feet and bill are also black they measure 40–53 cm 16–21 in in length of which the tail makes up about 40 the wing chord is 245 to 33 cm 96 to 130 in with the wingspan ranging from 85 to 100 cm 33 to 39 in the bill length can be from 3 to 55 cm 12 to 22 in varying strongly according to location the tarsus is 55 to 65 cm 22 to 26 in and the tail is 135 to 19 cm 53 to 75 in 5  the body mass can vary from 316 to 620 g 111 to 219 oz males tend to be larger than females 8  9 brooklyn museum   american crow   john j audubonthe most usual call is a loud short and rapid caaw caaw caaw usually the birds thrust their heads up and down as they utter this call american crows can also produce a wide variety of sounds and sometimes mimic noises made by other animals including other birdsvisual differentiation from the fish crow c ossifragus is extremely difficult and often inaccurate nonetheless differences apart from size do exist fish crows tend to have more slender bills and feet there may also be a small sharp hook at the end of the upper bill fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking more dramatically when calling fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathersif seen flying at a distance from where size estimates are unreliable the distinctly larger common ravens c corax can be distinguished by their almost lozenge shaped tail and their larger looking heads they also fluff their throat feathers when calling like fish crows only more sothe average life span of the american crow in the wild is 7–8 years captive birds are known to have lived up to 30 years 10 distribution and habitat edit the range of the american crow now extends from the pacific ocean to the atlantic ocean in canada on the french islands of saint pierre and miquelon south through the united states and into northern mexico 1  the increase in trees throughout the great plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated range expansions of the american crow 11  as well as range expansions of many other species of birds 12  13  14  virtually all types of country from wilderness farmland parks open woodland to towns and major cities are inhabited it is absent only from pacific temperate rain forests and tundra habitat where it is replaced by the raven this crow is a permanent resident in most of the usa but most canadian birds migrate some distances southward in winter outside of the nesting season these birds often gather in large thousands or even millions 15  communal roosts at nightthe american crow was recorded in bermuda from 1876 onwards 16 behavior edit the american crow is omnivorous it will feed on invertebrates of all types carrion scraps of human food seeds eggs and nestlings stranded fish on the shore and various grains american crows are active hunters and will prey on mice frogs and other small animals in winter and autumn the diet of american crows is more dependent on nuts and acorns occasionally they will visit bird feeders 17  the american crow is one of only a few species of bird that has been observed modifying and using tools to obtain food 18 like most crows they will scavenge at landfills scattering garbage in the process where available corn wheat and other crops are a favorite food these habits have historically caused the american crow to be considered a nuisance however it is suspected that the harm to crops is offset by the service the american crow provides by eating insect pests 17 reproduction edit american crows are socially monogamous cooperative breeding birds mated pairs form large families of up to 15 individuals from several breeding seasons that remain together for many years 19  offspring from a previous nesting season will usually remain with the family to assist in rearing new nestlings american crows do not reach breeding age for at least two years 20  most do not leave the nest to breed for four to five years 19 the nesting season starts early with some birds incubating eggs by early april 21  american crows build bulky stick nests nearly always in trees but sometimes also in large bushes and very rarely on the ground they will nest in a wide variety of trees including large conifers although oaks are most often used three to six eggs are laid and incubated for 18 days the young are usually fledged by about 36 days after hatching predation primarily occurs at the nest site and eggs and nestlings are frequently eaten by snakes raccoons ravens and domestic cats adults are less frequently predated but face potential attack from great horned owls red tailed hawks peregrine falcons and eagles they may be attacked by predators such as coyotes or bobcats at carrion when incautious although this is even rarer 17  22 west nile virus edit american crows succumb easily to west nile virus infection this was originally a mosquito borne african virus causing encephalitis in humans and livestock since about 1000 ad and was accidentally introduced to north america in 1999 apparently by an infected air traveller who got bitten by a mosquito after arrival it is estimated that the american crow population has dropped by up to 45 since 1999 23  despite this decline the crow is considered a species of least concern 24  the disease runs most rampant in the subtropical conditions which encourage reproduction of its mosquito vectors among which culex tarsalis is most significant mortality rates appear to be higher than those in other birds causing local population losses of up to 72 in a single season 20  25  because of this american crows are a sentinel species indicating the presence of west nile virus in an area crows cannot transmit the virus to humans directly 10 status and conservation edit crows have been killed in large numbers by humans both for recreation and as part of organized campaigns of extermination 26 american crows are protected internationally by the migratory bird treaty act of 1918 despite attempts by humans in some areas to drive away or eliminate these birds they remain widespread and very common the number of individual american crows is estimated by birdlife international to be around 31000000 the large population as well as its vast range are the reasons why the american crow is considered to be of least concern meaning that the species is not threatened 1 references edit  a b c birdlife

fish crow   wikipedia the fish crow corvus ossifragus is a species of crow associated with wetland habitats in the eastern and southeastern united statestaxonomy edit the fish crow was first described by alexander wilson in 1812 the latest genetic testing now seems to indicate this species is close to the sinaloan crow c sinaloae and the tamaulipas crow c imparatus and not as close to the american crow c brachyrhynchos as outward signs would suggest  2 description edit composite image of fish crowsthe fish crow is superficially similar to the american crow but is smaller 36–41 cm in length and has a more silky smooth plumage by comparison the upperparts have a blue or blue green sheen while the underparts have a more greenish tint to the black the eyes are dark brown the differences are often only really apparent between the two species when seen side by side or when heard calling the bill is usually somewhat slimmer than the american crow but is only readily distinguishable if both species are seen together 3 visual differentiation from the american crow is extremely difficult and often inaccurate 4  nonetheless differences apart from size do exist fish crows tend to have more slender bills and feet there may also be a small sharp hook at the end of the upper bill fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking more dramatically when calling fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathersthe voice is the most outwardly differing characteristic for this species and other american crow species the call of the fish crow has been described as a nasal ark ark ark or a begging waw waw birders often distinguish the two species in areas where their range overlaps with the mnemonic aid just ask him if he is an american crow if he says no he is a fish crow referring to the fact that the most common call of the american crow is a distinct caw caw while that of the fish crow is a nasal nyuh unh 5 distribution and habitat edit this species occurs on the eastern seaboard of the united states from rhode island south to key west and west along the northern coastline of the gulf of mexico and follows many river systems inland for quite some distance coastal marshes and beaches rivers inland lakes and marshes river banks and the land immediately surrounding all are frequented 3 behavior edit food is taken mainly from the ground and even in shallow water where the bird hovers and plucks food items out of the water with its feet the fish crow is omnivorous it feeds on small crustaceans such as crabs and shrimps other invertebrates stranded fish and live fish if the situation favors their capture eggs and nestlings of birds small reptiles the fruits of many trees peanuts and grains as well as human scraps where available 3 breeding edit the nest is usually built high in a tree and is often accompanied in nearby trees with other nests of the same species forming small loose colonies usually four or five eggs are laid pale blue green in colour they bear blotches of olive brown 6 conservation edit this species appears to be somewhat more resistant to west nile virus than the american crow survival rates of up to 45 have been reported for fish crows compared with near zero for the american species 7 references edit further reading edit goodwin d 1983 crows of the world queensland university press st lucia qld isbn 0 7022 1015 3 external links edit sound link edit image links edit 
black billed cuckoo   wikipedia the black billed cuckoo coccyzus erythropthalmus is a new world species in the cuculidae cuckoo family the scientific name is from ancient greek the genus name kokkuzo means to call like a common cuckoo and erythropthalmus is from eruthros red and ophthalmos eye 2 it is very similar and overlaps in range with the closely related yellow billed cuckoo a distinguishing characteristic of family cuculidae is laying eggs in the nests of other birds although many cuckoos are obligate brood parasites c erythropthalmus often incubate their own chicks 3 description edit

and may contain some rufous coloration on the wing the adults have a narrow red orbital ring while the juveniles is yellow 7  black billed cuckoo chicks have white sparsely distributed sheath like down that contrasts heavily with their black skin they also have complex creamy colored structures on their mouth and tongue which may appear like warts or some type of parasitic infection however they are normal for the species 8 this juvenile black billed cuckoo was banded at mcgill bird observatory mbo in june 2015habitat edit c erythropthalmus may be found in a variety of habitats they are most commonly found around the edges of mature deciduous or mixed forests and much less frequently in coniferous forests they can also be found in much younger growth forests with a lot of shrubs and thickets wetlands with a lot of alder and willow are another prime location to see them lastly they can also inhabit more open areas such as abandoned farmland golf courses and residential parks whatever the habitat may be they are usually quite well hidden and tend to stick to the edges of these habitats the chosen habitat must also have a water source nearby such as a lake river marsh or pond on their wintering grounds in south america they can inhabit tropical rainforests deciduous or semiopen woodlands as well as scrub forests 6 breeding migrating and wintering ranges of the black billed cuckoowhen breeding the species is distributed in wooded areas across much of the united states east of the rockies their range just barely extends into north carolina arkansas oklahoma and tennessee they are not present to the south of those states when breeding they can also be found in southern regions of alberta saskatchewan manitoba ontario and quebec theyre also present in the maritime provinces of prince edward island eastern new brunswick and western nova scotia when migrating in spring and fall they can also be seen in southern united states as well as all of central america they migrate to northwestern south america in the fall where they will spend the winter 9  although they are mainly an eastern north american species there have been confirmed reports of them in british columbia washington and california 10  the species is also a rare vagrant to western europe and greenland 11   12   13 behavior edit feeding edit black billed cuckoo preying on tent caterpillar nestthese birds forage in shrubs or trees they mainly eat insects especially tent caterpillars but also some snails eggs of other birds and berries it is known to beat caterpillars against a branch before consuming them to remove some of the indigestible hairs remaining hairs accumulate in the stomach until the bird sheds the stomach lining and disgorges a pellet in a manner similar to owls 14  15 invasive gypsy moths may also serve as an important food source for black billed cuckoos most birds cannot consume gypsy moth caterpillars because of their hair like setae however cuckoos can consume them because of their ability to shed their abdominal lining during outbreak years of these insects the abundance of black billed cuckoos increased on breeding bird survey bbs routes this increase is not due to higher reproductive rate because then the black billed cuckoo populations would only increase the next year the abundance is higher because the cuckoos flock towards the outbreak areas this is supported by the fact that cuckoo abundance is actually lower than average in the areas surrounding the outbreaks suggesting a large influx of the birds towards outbreaks they are able to find these areas due to post migratory nomadic behavior once reaching their breeding ground they search vast expanses of forest for the most suitable breeding area in this case where there is an abundance of food similar patterns have also been observed during outbreaks of tent caterpillars fall webworms and cicadas 16  17 vocalization edit when they are a couple days old the chicks can make a buzzing sound that resembles an insect and a few days later they can make a low barking call when disturbed the call of this species is 2 5 sets of coo notes that are high pitched rapid and repetitive there is a slight pause between each set the phonetics are often written coo coo coo coo coo coo coo coo coo coo coo coo  adults usually call during the day when breeding however they begin calling at night in the middle of summer 6  9 reproduction edit prior to copulation the male lands on a branch near the female with an insect in its beak the female will then flick her tail up and down intermittently for about 15 minutes while the male sits there motionless the male then mounts the female with the insect still in its mouth and the two copulate the male then either eats the food item or gives it to the female for her to eat 6 adult black billed cuckoo hiding in some branchesfemales usually lay 2 3 blue green eggs sometimes 4 or 5 which may take on a marbled appearance after a couple days of incubation adults incubate the eggs for 10–13 days the young black billed cuckoos as well as others cuckoos in the genus coccyzus leave the nest 7–9 days after hatching which is quite young when compared to other birds the young are not able to fly right away however they can still move quite large distances by jumping between tree branches during this period they are more vulnerable to predators because they cannot fly away as the adults could due to this vulnerability the juveniles can slowly assume an erect posture to conceal themselves they stretch their neck out and point their bill upwards while keeping their eyes open and remaining motionless if the threat starts to back off the cuckoo will relax its pose 18 outbreaks of tent caterpillars can have a positive effect on black billed cuckoo populations during these outbreaks the adults begin laying eggs earlier in the season they can also produce larger clutches and may even increase their parasitic activities 19 adult black billed cuckoobrood parasitism edit black billed cuckoos are known to lay their eggs in the nests of other birds they can lay eggs in the nests of other black billed cuckoos called conspecific parasitism or in the nests of other songbirds known as interspecific parasitism the females will usually parasitize nests in the afternoon because the nests are often unguarded at this time this cuckoo species is thought to have a laying interval of about a day so if two eggs show up in a nest on the same day you can rightfully assume that one is a parasitic egg 3 many cuckoos are obligate brood parasites meaning they only lay eggs in other birds nests and never take care of their own young birds that do this such as the common cuckoo or the brown headed cowbird lay relatively small eggs because their expected hosts are usually smaller birds cuckoos in the genus coccyzus lay relatively large eggs even though they still parasitize smaller birds yellow warblers are the smallest birds recorded caring for black billed cuckoo eggs in experiments these wood warblers were found to accept the cuckoo eggs 63 of the time even though their own eggs are only a quarter of the size even with the size difference the warbler parent is often still able to raise the cuckoo as long as it can provide the chick with sufficient nutrition and incubation 20 taxonomy edit the black billed cuckoo was originally placed in genus cuculus this genus comprises old world cuckoos that are all obligate brood parasites upon further genetic testing it was placed into genus coccyzus that comprises nine species of new world cuckoos the black billed and yellow billed cuckoos are the only two that migrate into north america while the other seven are permanent residents of either central or south america even though these two cuckoos overlap in range they are not sister taxa this suggests that the two species invaded north america separately although family cuculidae is monophyletic the genus coccyzus was found to be polyphyletic 21  22 conservation edit although the black billed cuckoo is classified as least concern ln on the iucn red list its population is still on the decline it faces many of the same challenges as many other north american songbirds pesticides are having a large effect on them because the chemicals are depleting their food resources other threats include the loss of habitat especially in their wintering tropical habitats as well as urbanization as with other migratory birds they frequently encounter large buildings on their migratory routes which they may collide with resulting in death 9 references edit  birdlife international 2012 coccyzus erythropthalmus iucn red list of threatened species version 20132 international union for

gray crowned rosy finch   wikipedia the gray crowned rosy finch or gray crowned rosy finch leucosticte tephrocotis is a species of passerine bird in the family fringillidae native to alaska western canada and the north western united states due to its remote and rocky alpine habitat it is rarely seen there are currently six recognized subspecies it is one of four species of rosy finchestaxonomy edit the gray crowned rosy finch was first classified by english ornithologist william john swainson in 1832 1  this bird has been thought to form a superspecies with three other rosy finches also known as mountain finch black rosy finch l atrata and the brown capped rosy finch l australis all of which were classified as the same species as the asian rosy finch l arctoa from 1983 1993 2  3  4  recent mitochondrial dna evidence shows the rosy finches are all indeed very closely related and can be easily confused with one another 5  along with four asian rosy finches the three north american rosy finches form the mountain finch genus leucosticte alternative common names include roselin à tête grise in french schwarzstirn schneegimpel in german and pinzón montano nuquigrís in spanish 6 subspecies edit six subspecies of the gray crowned rosy finch are now recognized though proposals for additional subspecies have been recognized 6 l t griseonucha j f brandt 1842 commander island and

 adults are brown on the back and breast and mainly pink on the rest of the underparts and the wings the forehead and throat are black the back of the head is grey they have short black legs and a long forked tail there is some variability in the amount of grey on the head adult females and juveniles are similar 8  overall length is 140 to 160 mm 55–63 in wingspan 33 mm 13 in and weight 22 to 26 g 078–092 oz 2  l t wallowa has an almost entirely gray head 7  the pribilof and aleutian subspecies have a length of 170 to 210 mm 67–83 in and weight of 42 to 60 g 15–21 oz about twice the size of the other subspecies 2  5  the black rosy finch has a black instead of brown body and the brown capped rosy finch is a lighter brown and lacks the gray face patch 8 distribution and habitat edit the ancestor of the three species of north american rosy finches migrated from asia 9  all rosy finches live in an alpine or tundra environment the gray crowned rosy finch has a wide range 10  and large numbers throughout alaska and western canada and the united states l t griseonucha permanently resides in the aleutian islands and umbrina on the pribilof islands a small number of gray crowned rosy finches winters on the mainland in south central alaska and visits feeders there the other taxa littoralis tephrocotis wallowa and dawsoni are found from the canadian and american rockies and migrate south to the western united states 1  l t tephrocotis summers from montana to the yukon while littoralis breeds closer to the coast from northern california to west central alaska 4  due to its remote habitat few of its nests have been found it is rarely spotted and the population is stable 2  7  they are invariably found amongst rocks 7  the areas the subspecies breed in rarely overlap during breeding season males typically outnumber females throughout the year 5  an individual was seen north of boonville in lewis county ny beginning on sunday march 4 through at least thursday march 8 this is only the second confirmed report for new york state 11 behavior edit rosy finches are very environment specific in the summer their breeding habitat is rocky islands and barren areas on mountains from alaska to the northwestern united states these mountain breeding areas tend to be snowfields and rocky scree 7  when not breeding they form large flocks of over 1000 individuals which are sometimes known to include snow buntings p nivalis lapland longspurs c lapponicus and horned larks e alpestris as well as other rosy finch species 5  7  they descend in flocks as far as the fringes of the western plains beginning in autumn when the snows get deep they return to alpine regions when snow is still deep in early spring 7  they may breed at a higher altitude than any other breeding bird in north america 3  7  due to these extreme breeding altitudes they are very difficult to observe during breeding times 3  7  they build a cup nest in mid june at a sheltered hidden location on the ground or on a cliff and are monogamous 7  they are known to use protected areas such as mine shafts and abandoned buildings for nesting 5  both sexes collect the nesting material of grass roots lichen moss and sedge but only the female builds the nest lining material consists of fine grass hair and feathers the female lays 3–5 eggs which she incubates for approximately two weeks both sexes feed the chicks which leave the nest after 2–3 weeks chicks continue to be fed by their parents for about two weeks after leaving the nest in late july or early august 7  a male will defend its females territory during breeding season not just the nest but wherever she goes this behavior is common with the rosy finches 5  12 these birds forage on the ground many fly to catch insects in flight during the summer they mainly eat insects such as cutworms that were caught in updrafts and frozen in snowfields they also feed in the meadows near snowfields 5  in the winter they eat seeds from weeds and grasses such as russian thistle e exaltatus mustard and sunflower h annuus when breeding both males and females develop throat pouches known as gular pouches or gular skin to carry food to their chicks 7  9  a trait seen in only one other north american genus pinicola 13  the three subspecies that live in mountain interiors have brown cheeks instead of gray cheeks they show little fear of humans 2  7  they often feed in small flocks their call is a buzz sounding chew 14  they can be approached to within 1 to 2 m 33–66 ft 3 references edit  a b c birdlife international 2012

subspecies plumage varies as described in taxonomy sectioncall and flight edit this birds call is a sustained laugh ki ki ki ki more congenial than that of the pileated woodpecker one may also hear a constant knocking as they often drum on trees or even metal objects to declare territory like most woodpeckers northern flickers drum on objects as a form of communication and territory defense in such cases the object is to make as loud a noise as possible and that’s why woodpeckers sometimes drum on metal objectslike many woodpeckers its flight is undulating the repeated cycle of a quick succession of flaps followed by a pause creates an effect comparable to a rollercoasterbehavior edit according to the audubon guide flickers are the only woodpeckers that frequently feed on the ground probing with their beak also sometimes catching insects in flight although they eat fruits berries seeds and nuts their primary food is insects ants alone can make up 45 of their diet other invertebrates eaten include flies butterflies moths beetles and snails flickers also eat berries and seeds especially in winter including poison oak and ivy dogwood sumac wild cherry and grape bayberries hackberries and elderberries and sunflower and thistle seeds flickers often go after ants underground where the nutritious larvae live hammering at the soil the way other woodpeckers drill into wood they have been observed breaking into cow patties to eat insects living within their tongues can dart out 50 mm 20 in beyond the end of the bill to snare prey as well as eating ants flickers have a behavior called anting during which they use the acid from the ants to assist in preening as it is useful in keeping them free of parasiteshabitat edit flickers may be observed in open habitats near trees including woodlands edges yards and parks in the western united states one can find them in mountain forests all the way up to treeline northern flickers generally nest in holes in trees like other woodpeckers occasionally they have been found nesting in old earthen burrows vacated by belted kingfishers or bank swallows both sexes help with nest excavation the entrance hole is about 76 cm 30 in in diameter and the cavity is 33–41 cm 13–16 in deep the cavity widens at bottom to make room for eggs and the incubating adult inside the cavity is bare except for a bed of wood chips for

great crested flycatcher   wikipedia the great crested flycatcher myiarchus crinitus is a large insect eating bird of the tyrant flycatcher family it is the most widespread member of the genus myiarchus in north america and is found over most of the eastern and mid western portions of the continent 2  it dwells mostly in the treetops and rarely is found on the ground 3 description edit adult great crested flycatchers usually measure between 17–21 cm 67–83 in in length with a wingspan of around 34 cm 13 in this bird usually weighs between 27–40 g 095–141 oz 3 the great crested flycatcher does not display sexual dimorphism all adults are brownish on the upperparts with yellow underparts they have a long rusty brown tail and a bushy crest their throat and breast are greytheir breeding habitat is deciduous or mixed forests across eastern north america they nest in a cavity in a tree usually a snake skin is included in the lining of the nest but sometimes a plastic wrapper is substitutedthey wait on a high perch and fly out to catch insects in flight sometimes they may be seen hovering to pick food off of vegetation buildings and even windows they also eat fruits and berriesthe call of these birds is a whistled weepthese birds migrate to mexico and south america as well as to florida and cubahabitat and distribution edit the great crested flycatcher habitat selection may vary slightly with different populations but can be most often found breeding in deciduous forests and at edges of clearings and mixed woodlands they also show a tendency to favour landscapes with open canopy such as second growth forests or woodlands that have been subjected to selective cutting and also appears to avoid coniferous dominant habitats such as the canadian boreal forest 4 the summer breeding ground covers all eastern mid eastern and parts of central united states including northern parts of the florida peninsula parts of texas central oklahoma and eastern and central north dakota 5 in canada it is limited to southern manitoba extreme southern portions of the st lawrence forest of ontario quebec northeast nova scotia and parts of prince edward island 6 its winter range includes most of southern mexico and the yucatán peninsula and extends along the costs of central america in southern peninsular florida great crested flycatcher can be found year round 4 behaviour edit vocalization edit males will sing a three part song composed of two short whistles a wheerreep followed by a higher pitched whee and a soft low churr this song is meant to be heard by a mate at short distances indicating periods of low disturbance and stress typically intensifying just before dawn it is appropriately named dawn song or twilight song 7  8 in addition to the dawn song great crested flycatcher also produce various calls a series of fast ascending huit huit huit is given in moments of stress or excitement during interactions of between neighbours 8  the most characteristic sound is perhaps a single loud whee eep called out to communicate between mates or parents and young birds a faster repetition of this call often signal predators in proximity to nests and young 8  a rapid succession of harsh sounds rasps signals alarm or stress often heard during territorial disputes between neighbouring birds  8  9 the great crested flycatcher is primarily an insectivore with insects and other invertebrates making up for the majority of its diet but will also consume small portion of small fruits and berries despite the flycatcher of the birds name flies along with spiders make up only a small percentage of its diet it prefers prey such as butterflies moths beetles grasshoppers crickets and bees and wasps 10 great crested flycatchers will use a variety of hunting tactics although the most common method observed is a rather passive sit and wait strategy perched in high canopies they search in all direction often accompanied by a characteristic head bobbing once they have spotted a potential prey they swoop down and will pursue if they missed on the first dive 5  they can also be seen abruptly braking and hovering picking insects or small fruits off of leaves trunks or other surfaces sometimes crashing into the foliage in the process 5  8 fruits and berries when consumed are swallowed whole and the pits later regurgitated 8 breeding edit nest building begins as early as mid april for populations of the southern distribution 11  and as late as june for northern populations ie manitoba 9 great crested flycatchers are socially monogamous  12  with chances of pairs reforming in following years given that both members of the pair survive the winter 6  pairs have been observed to attempt copulation from the beginning of nest building all the way to the hatching of young sometimes during the nest building process this is thought to be a strategy developed by males in order to prevent female infidelity 11  mating ritual for the great crested flycatcher is described as males swooping down from a high perch in order to initiate mating with females sometimes hovering near hideaway if female retreats before returning to perch and repeating diving routine until mating is successful 6 although both parents will inspect potential sites building of the nest is done almost entirely by the female while the male closely guards its mate 12  cavities than are large enough in size and opening are the preferred nesting sites whether naturally occurring or excavated by other species 8 as well as use nesting boxes and other man made structures 12  most chosen cavities are situated between 2m and 6m off the forest ground 1115 the nest itself is built within 2 to 4 days and is composed mostly of vegetation and plant fibers such as grasses moss leaves but also pieces of animal fur and feathers pieces of shed snakeskin and artificial materials ex strings tape cloth and plastic objects 12  the inner diameter ranges from 7–9 cm 12 great crested flycatchers lay a single clutch of 4 8 eggs which are incubated on average for two weeks by the female only 9  12  13  after hatching nestlings will typically spend another two weeks in the nest before fledging during this time nestlings are fed an insect dominated diet by both parents although females will make more frequent visits 12  13

vermilion flycatcher   wikipedia the vermilion flycatcher pyrocephalus rubinus is a small passerine bird in the tyrannidae or tyrant flycatcher family most flycatchers are rather drab but the vermilion flycatcher is a striking exception it is a favorite with birders but is not generally kept in aviculture as the males tend to lose their vermilion coloration when in captivitytaxonomy edit when pieter boddaert first described the vermilion flycatcher in 1783 from a specimen collected in tefé brazil he assigned it to the genus muscicapa believing it to be related to the many old world flycatchers already belonging to that genus 2  by the 1830s however taxonomists realized that old world and new world flycatchers were not closely related and the new world birds were moved from their former genera in 1839 john gould created the current genus pyrocephalus for the vermilion flycatcher 3  while it is considered a monotypic genus by many authorities some taxonomists believe that one or both of the vermilion flycatcher subspecies found on the galápagos islands merit species status 2 there are 12 widely recognized subspecies which differ primarily in the color and saturation of the males plumage and the color and amount of streaking of the females the boundaries between some of the subspecies are not well defined 2 p r ardens described by john todd zimmer in 1941 is found in northern peru in extreme eastern piura cajamarca and amazonas 2 p r blatteus described by outram bangs in 1911 is found in southeastern mexico belize and northern guatemala 2 p r cocachacrae described

venezuela guyana and northern brazil 2 the validity of a thirteenth subspecies p r major has been questioned as its breeding grounds have never been found 2 description edit the vermilion flycatcher is a small bird measuring 13–14 cm 51–55 in in length with a mass between 11 and 14 g 039 and 049 oz 2  it strongly dimorphic males are bright red with dark brown plumage females have a peach colored belly with a dark gray upperside and are similar to says phoebegallery edit distribution and habitat edit vermilion flycatchers generally prefer somewhat open areas and are found in trees or shrubs in savannah scrub agricultural areas riparian woodlands and desert as well but usually near water their range includes almost all of mexico it extends north into the southwestern united states and south to scattered portions of central america parts of northwestern and central south america and on southwards to central argentina they are also found in the galápagos islands it has ranged as far north as canada 5 behavior edit feeding edit the flycatchers feed mostly on insects such as flies grasshoppers and beetles these are usually taken in mid air after a short sally flight from a perch 6  it is an opportunistic feeder and has been observed eating small fish 7 breeding edit the vermilion flycatchers nest is a shallow cup made of small twigs and soft materials lined with hair the nests rim is often covered with lichen typically located within 6 ft 18 m of the ground the nest is placed in the horizontal fork of a tree branch 8  they lay two or three whitish eggs in a nest made of twigs stems and roots and lined with hair the eggs are incubated for around two weeks by the female and the young are ready to leave the nest 15 days after hatchingconservation and threats edit because of its enormous range and sizable population—estimated as ranging between 5000000 and 50000000 individuals—the vermilion flycatcher is listed as a species of least concern by the international union for the conservation of nature despite the fact that its overall numbers are declining 1  some of its subspecies however are known to be in trouble p r dubius which was once reportedly common on san cristóbal has not been recorded from that island since the mid 1980s and is thought to be extinct 4  the other galápagos subspecies p r nanus is also declining precipitously principally as a result of the spread of the nonnative smooth billed ani across the archipelago 9  the ani is known to be predatory sometimes killing though apparently not eating nestling flycatchers 10 the flycatcher is also an occasional victim of brood parasitism by brown headed cowbirds 11 references edit  a b birdlife international 2012 pyrocephalus rubinus iucn red list of threatened species version 20132

frigatebird   wikipedia frigatebirds also listed as frigate bird frigate bird frigate frigate petrel 1  are a family of seabirds called fregatidae which are found across all tropical and subtropical oceans the five extant species are classified in a single genus fregata all have predominantly black plumage long deeply forked tails and long hooked bills females have white underbellies and males have a distinctive red gular pouch which they inflate during the breeding season to attract females their wings are long and pointed and can span up to 23 metres 75 ft the largest wing area to body weight ratio of any birdable to soar for weeks on wind currents frigatebirds spend most of the day in flight hunting for food and roost on trees or cliffs at night their main prey are fish and squid caught when chased to the water surface by large predators such as tuna frigatebirds are referred to as kleptoparasites as they occasionally rob other seabirds for food and are known to snatch seabird chicks from the nest seasonally monogamous frigatebirds nest colonially a rough nest is constructed in low trees or on the ground on remote islands a single egg is laid each breeding season the duration of parental care is among the longest of any bird species frigatebirds are only able to breed every other yearthe fregatidae are a sister group to suloidea which consists of cormorants darters gannets and boobies three of the five extant species of frigatebirds are widespread the magnificent great and lesser frigatebirds while two are endangered the christmas island and ascension island frigatebirds and restrict their breeding habitat to one small island each the oldest fossils date to the early eocene around 50 million years ago classified in the genus limnofregata the three species had shorter less hooked bills and longer legs and lived in a freshwater environmenttaxonomy edit etymology edit the term frigate bird itself was used in 1738 by the english naturalist and illustrator eleazar albin in his a natural history of the birds the book included an illustration of the male bird showing the red gular pouch 2  like the genus name the english term is derived from the french mariners name for the bird la frégate—a frigate or fast warship 3  the etymology was mentioned by french naturalist jean baptiste du tertre when describing the bird in 1667 4  a christopher columbus encountered frigatebirds when passing the cape verde islands on his first voyage across the atlantic in 1492 in his journal entry for 29 september he used the word rabiforçado modern spanish rabihorcado or forktail 5  6  b  in the caribbean frigatebirds were called man of war birds by english mariners this name was used by the english explorer william dampier in his book an account of a new voyage around the world published in 1697 7 the man of war as it is called by the english is about the bigness of a kite and in shape like it but black and the neck is red it lives on fish yet never lights on the water but soars aloft like a kite and when it sees its prey it flys down head foremost to the waters edge very swiftly takes its prey out of the sea with his bill and immediately mounts again as swiftly never touching the water with his bill his wings are very long his feet are like other land fowl and he builds on trees where he finds any but where they are wanting on the ground 7 classification edit frigatebirds were grouped with cormorants and sulids gannets and boobies as well as pelicans in the genus pelecanus by linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his systema naturae he described the distinguishing characteristics as a straight bill hooked at the tip linear nostrils a bare face and fully webbed feet 8  the genus fregata was defined by french naturalist bernard germain de lacépède in 1799 9  10  louis jean pierre vieillot described the genus name tachypetes in 1816 for the great frigatebird the genus name atagen had been coined by german naturalist paul möhring in 1752 though this has no validity as it predates the official beginning of linnaean taxonomy 11 in 1874 english zoologist alfred henry garrod published a study where he had examined various groups of birds and recorded which muscles of a selected group of five c  they possessed or lacked noting that the muscle patterns were different among the steganopodes classical pelecaniformes he resolved that there were divergent lineages in the group that should be in separate families including frigatebirds in their own family fregatidae 12  urless n lanham observed in 1947 that frigatebirds bore some skeletal characteristics more in common with procellariiformes than pelecaniformes though concluded they still belonged in the latter group as suborder fregatae albeit as an early offshoot 13  martyn kennedy and colleagues derived a cladogram based on behavioural characteristics of the traditional pelecaniformes calculating the frigatebirds to be more divergent than pelicans from a core group of gannets darters and cormorants and tropicbirds the most distant lineage 14  the classification of this group as the traditional pelecaniformes united by feet that are totipalmate with all four toes linked by webbing and the presence of a gular pouch persisted until the early 1990s 15  the dna–dna hybridization studies of charles sibley and jon edward ahlquist placed the frigatebirds in a lineage with penguins loons petrels and albatrosses 16  subsequent genetic studies place the frigatebirds as a sister group to the group suloidea which comprises the gannets and boobies cormorants and darters 17  18  microscopic analysis of eggshell structure by konstantin mikhailov in 1995 found that the eggshells of frigatebirds resembled those of other pelecaniformes in having a covering of thick microglobular material over the crystalline shells 19 molecular studies have consistently shown that pelicans the namesake family of the pelecaniformes are actually more closely related to herons ibises and spoonbills the hamerkop and the shoebill than to the remaining species in recognition of this the order comprising the frigatebirds and suloidea was renamed suliformes in 2010 20  21 in 1994 the family name fregatidae cited as described in 1867 by french naturalists côme damien degland and zéphirin gerbe was conserved under article 40b of the international code of zoological nomenclature in preference to the 1840 description tachypetidae by johann friedrich von brandt this was because the genus names atagen and tachypetes had been synonymised with fregata before 1961 resulting in the aligning of family and genus names 22 fossil record edit fossil of eocene species limnofregata azygosternonthe eocene frigatebird genus limnofregata comprises birds whose fossil remains were recovered from prehistoric freshwater environments unlike the marine preferences of their modern day relatives they had shorter less hooked bills and longer legs and longer slit like nasal openings 23  three species have been described from fossil deposits in the western united states two—l azygosternon and l hasegawai—from the green river formation 48–52 million years old and one—l hutchisoni—from the wasatch formation between 53 and 55 million years of age 24  fossil material indistinguishable from living species dating to the pleistocene and holocene has been recovered from ascension island for f aquila 25  saint helena island 26  both in the southern atlantic ocean and also from various islands in the pacific ocean for f minor and f ariel 27  28 a cladistic study of the skeletal and bone morphology of the classical pelecaniformes and relatives found that the frigatebirds formed a clade with limnofregata birds of the two genera have 15 cervical vertebrae unlike almost all other ciconiiformes suliformes and pelecaniformes which have 17 the age of limnofregata indicates that these lineages had separated by the eocene 18 living species and infrageneric classification edit frigatebird phylogeny 29 the type species of the genus is the ascension frigatebird fregata aquila 30  for many years the consensus was to recognise only two species of frigatebird with larger birds as f aquila and smaller as f ariel in 1914 the australian ornithologist gregory mathews delineated five species which remain valid 29  31  analysis of ribosomal and mitochondrial dna indicated that the five species had diverged from a common ancestor only recently—as little as 15 million years ago there are two species pairs the great and christmas island frigatebirds and the magnificent and ascension frigatebirds while the fifth species the lesser frigatebird is an early offshoot of the common ancestor of the other four species 29  three subspecies of the lesser and five subspecies of the great frigatebird are recognised 32 living species of frigatebirdscommon and binomial namesimagedescriptionrangemagnificent frigatebirdfregata magnificensmathews 1914with a body length of 89–114 cm 35–45 in it is the largest species and has the longest bill the adult male is all black with a scarlet throat pouch that is inflated like a balloon in the breeding season although the feathers are black the scapular feathers have a purple sheen in contrast to the male great frigatebirds green sheen the female is brownish black but has a white breast and lower neck sides a brown band on the wings and a blueish grey eye ring 33 widespread in the tropical atlantic it breeds in colonies in trees in florida the caribbean and cape verde islands as well as along the pacific coast of the americas from mexico to ecuador including the galápagos islands 34 ascension frigatebirdfregata aquilalinnaeus 1758apart from its smaller size the adult male is very similar to the magnificent frigatebird the female is brownish black with a rusty brown mantle and chest and normally lacks any white patches present on the front of female birds of other species the occasional female observed with a white belly may be breeding before obtaining the full adult plumage 35 it is found on boatswain bird island just off ascension island in the tropical atlantic ocean having not bred on the main island since the 1800s 36 christmas frigatebirdfregata andrewsimathews 1914the adult male is the only frigatebird species with white

white 37 tropical and subtropical waters across the indian and pacific oceans atlantic race trinitatis was limited to trindade off eastern brazil but may now be extinct 40  41 description edit male magnificent frigatebird in the galapagos islandsfrigatebirds are large slender mostly black plumaged seabirds with the five species similar in appearance to each other the largest species is the magnificent frigatebird which reaches 114 cm 45 in in length with three of the remaining four almost as large the lesser frigatebird is substantially smaller at around 71 cm 28 in long frigatebirds exhibit marked sexual dimorphism females are larger and up to 25 percent heavier than males 42  and generally have white markings on their underparts 43  frigatebirds have short necks and long slender hooked bills 42  their long narrow wings male wingspan can reach 23 metres 75 ft taper to points their wings have eleven primary flight feathers with the tenth the longest and eleventh a vestigial feather only and 23 secondaries their tails are deeply forked though this is not apparent unless the tail is fanned 44  the tail and wings give them a distinctive w silhouette in flight 42  the legs and face are fully feathered the totipalmate feet are short and weak the webbing is reduced and part of each toe is free 44 the bones of frigatebirds are markedly pneumatic filled with air making them very light and contribute only 5 to total body weight the pectoral girdle shoulder joint is strong as its bones are fused the pectoral muscles are well developed and weigh as much as the frigatebirds feathers—around half the body weight is made up equally of these muscles and feathers 42  the males have inflatable red coloured throat pouches called gular pouches which they inflate to attract females during the mating season 43  the gular sac is perhaps the most striking frigatebird feature these can only deflate slowly so males that are disturbed will fly off with pouches distended for some time 42 frigatebirds remain in the air and do not settle on the ocean they produce very little oil from their uropygial glands so their feathers would become sodden if they settled on the surface in addition with their long wings relative to body size they would have great difficulty taking off again 42 distribution and habitat edit frigatebirds are found over tropical oceans and ride warm updrafts under cumulus clouds their range coincides with availability of food such as flying fish and with the trade winds which provide the windy conditions that facilitate their flying 42  they are rare vagrants to temperate regions and not found in polar latitudes adults are generally sedentary remaining near the islands where they breed 42  however male frigatebirds have been recorded dispersing great distances after departing a breeding colony—one male great frigatebird relocated from europa island in the mozambique channel to the maldives 4400 km 2700 mi away and a male magnificent frigatebird flew 1400 km 870 mi from french guiana to trinidad 45  great frigatebirds marked with wing tags on tern island in the french frigate shoals were found to regularly travel the 873 km 542 mi to johnston atoll although one was reported in quezon city in the philippines genetic testing seems to indicate that the species has fidelity to their site of hatching despite their high mobility 46  young birds may disperse far and wide with distances of up to 6000 km 3700 mi recorded 42 behaviour and ecology edit magnificent frigatebirds drinking freshwaterhaving the largest wing area to body weight ratio of any bird frigatebirds are essentially aerial 42  this allows them to soar continuously and only rarely flap their wings one great frigatebird being tracked by satellite in the indian ocean stayed aloft for two months they can fly higher than 4000 meters in freezing conditions 47  like swifts they are able to spend the night on the wing but they will also return to an island to roost on trees or cliffs 48  field observations in the mozambique channel found that great frigatebirds could remain on the wing for up to 12 days while foraging 49  highly adept they use their forked tails for steering during flight and make strong deep wing beats 44  though not suited to flying by sustained flapping frigatebirds bathe and clean themselves in flight by flying low and splashing at the water surface before preening and scratching afterwards 42  conversely frigatebirds do not swim and with their short legs cannot walk well or take off from the sea easily 44 the average life span is unknown but in common with seabirds such as the wandering albatross and leachs storm petrel frigatebirds are long lived in 2002 35 ringed great frigatebirds were recovered on tern island in the hawaiian islands of these ten were older than 37 years and one was at least 44 years of age 50 despite having dark plumage in a tropical climate frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly as they are exposed to full sunlight when on the nest they ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings and males frequently flutter their gular pouches 42 feeding edit an immature great frigatebird snatching a sooty tern chickfrigatebirds feeding habits are pelagic and they may forage up to 500 km 310 mi from land they do not land on the water but snatch prey from the ocean surface using their long hooked bills 44  they mainly catch small fish such as flying fish particularly the genera exocoetus and cypselurus that are driven to the surface by predators such as tuna and dolphinfish 48  but they will also eat cephalopods particularly squid 44  menhaden of the genus brevoortia can be an important prey item where common and jellyfish and larger plankton are also eaten frigatebirds have learned to follow fishing vessels and take fish from holding areas 42  conversely tuna fishermen fish in areas where they catch sight of frigatebirds due to their association with large marine predators 51  frigatebirds also at times prey directly on eggs and young of other seabirds including boobies petrels shearwaters and terns in particular the sooty tern 42 frigatebirds will rob other seabirds such as boobies particularly the red footed booby tropicbirds shearwaters petrels terns gulls and even ospreys of their catch using their speed and manoeuvrability to outrun and harass their victims until they regurgitate their stomach contents they may either assail their targets after they have caught their food or circle high over seabird colonies waiting for parent birds to return laden with food 42  although frigatebirds are renowned for their kleptoparasitic feeding behaviour kleptoparasitism is not thought to play a significant part of the diet of any species and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting 52  a study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40 of the food they needed and on average obtained only 5 53 unlike most other seabirds frigatebirds drink freshwater when they come across it by swooping down and gulping with their bills 42 breeding behaviour edit magnificent frigatebird male breeding displayfrigatebirds typically breed on remote oceanic islands generally in colonies of up to 5000 birds within these colonies they most often nest in groups of 10 to 30 or rarely 100 individuals 44  breeding can occur at any time of year often prompted by commencement of the dry season or plentiful food 42 frigatebirds have the most elaborate mating displays of all seabirds the male birds take up residence in the colony in groups of up to thirty individuals 42  they display to females flying overhead by pointing their bills upwards inflating their red throat pouches and vibrating their outstretched wings showing the lighter wing undersurfaces in the process they produce a drumming sound by vibrating their bills together and sometimes give a whistling call 44  the female descends to join a male she has chosen and allows him to take her bill in his the pair also engages in mutual head snaking 42 after copulation it is generally the male who gathers sticks and the female that constructs the loosely woven nest the nest is subsequently covered with and cemented by guano frigatebirds prefer to nest in trees or bushes though when these are not available they will nest on the ground a single white egg that weighs up to 6–7 of mothers body mass is laid and is incubated in turns by both birds for 41 to 55 days the altricial chicks are naked on hatching and develop a white down they are continuously guarded by the parents for the first 4–6 weeks and are fed on the nest for 5–6 months 44  both parents take turns feeding for the first three months after which the males attendance tails off leaving the mother to feed the young for another six to nine months on average 42  the chicks feed by reaching their heads in their parents throat and eating the part regurgitated food it takes so long to rear a chick that frigatebirds generally breed every other year 44 the duration of parental care in frigatebirds is among the longest for birds rivalled only by the southern ground hornbill and some large accipitrids 54  frigatebirds take many years to reach sexual maturity a study of great frigatebirds in the galapagos islands found that they only bred once they have acquired the full adult plumage this was attained by female birds when they were eight to nine years of age and by male birds when they were ten to eleven years of age 55 parasites edit frigatebirds are unusual among seabirds in that they often carry blood parasites blood borne protozoa of the genus haemoproteus have been recovered from four of the five species 56  bird lice of the ischnoceran genus pectinopygus and amblyceran genus colpocephalum and species fregatiella aurifasciata have been recovered from magnificent and great frigatebirds of the galapagos islands frigatebirds tended to have more parasitic lice than did boobies analysed in the same study 57 a heavy chick mortality at a large and important colony of the magnificent frigatebird located on île du grand connétable off french guiana was recorded in summer 2005 chicks showed nodular skin lesions feather loss and corneal changes with around half the years progeny perishing across the colony an alphaherpesvirus was isolated and provisionally named fregata magnificens herpesvirus though it was unclear whether it caused the outbreak or affected birds already suffering malnutrition 58 status and conservation edit populations and threats edit two of the five species are considered at risk 42  in 2003 a survey of the four colonies of the critically endangered christmas island frigatebirds counted 1200 breeding pairs as frigatebirds normally breed every other year the total adult population was estimated to lie between 1800 and 3600 pairs larger numbers formerly bred on the island but the clearance of breeding habitat during world war ii and dust pollution from phosphate mining have contributed to the decrease 38  59  the population of the vulnerable ascension frigatebird has been estimated at around 12500 individuals 60  the birds formerly bred on ascension island itself but the colonies were exterminated by feral cats introduced in 1815 the birds continued to breed on a rocky outcrop just off the shore of the island a program conducted between 2002 and 2004 eradicated the feral cats 61  and a few birds have returned to nest on the island 62  63 the other three species are classified by the international union for conservation of nature as being of least concern the populations of all three are large with that of the magnificent frigatebird thought to be increasing 34  while the great and lesser frigatebird decreasing 39  64  monitoring populations of all species is difficult due to their movements across the open ocean and low reproductivity the status of the atlantic populations of the great and lesser frigatebirds are unknown and possibly extinct 42 as frigatebirds rely on large marine predators such as tuna for their prey overfishing threatens to significantly impact on food availability and jeopardise whole populations 51  as frigatebirds nest in large dense colonies in small areas they are vulnerable to local disasters that could wipe out the rare species or significantly impact the widespread ones 42 hunting edit in nauru catching frigatebirds was an important tradition still practised to a some degree donald w buden writes birds typically are captured by slinging the weighted end of a coil of line in front of an approaching bird attracted to previously captured birds used as decoys in a successful toss the line becomes entangled about the birds wing and bringing  sic  it to ground 65  marine birds including frigatebirds were once harvested for food on christmas island but this practice ceased in the late 1970s 59  eggs and young of magnificent frigatebirds were taken and eaten in the caribbean 42  great frigatebirds were eaten in the hawaiian islands and their feathers used for decoration 66 cultural significance edit the great frigatebird was venerated by the rapa nui people on easter island carvings of the birdman tangata manu depict him with the characteristic hooked beak and throat pouch 67  its incorporation into local ceremonies suggests that the now vanished species was extant there between the 1800s and 1860s 68 maritime folklore around the time america was discovered held that frigatebirds were birds of good omen as their presence meant land was near 42 there are anecdotal reports of tame frigatebirds being kept across polynesia and micronesia in the pacific a bird that had come from one island and had been taken elsewhere could be reliably trusted to return to its original home hence would be used as a speedy way to relay a message there 42  there is firmer evidence of this practice taking place in the gilbert islands and tuvalu 69 see also edit  du tertre wrote loyseau que les habitans des indes appellent fregate à cause de la vistesse

survives in a version recorded by bartholomé de las casas in the 1530s in english the entry reads they saw a bird that is called a frigatebird which makes the boobies throw up what they eat in order

northern fulmar   wikipedia the northern fulmar fulmarus glacialis fulmar 2  or arctic fulmar 4  is a highly abundant sea bird found primarily in subarctic regions of the north atlantic and north pacific oceans there has been one confirmed sighting in the southern hemisphere with a single bird seen south of new zealand 5  fulmars come in one of two color morphs a light one with white head and body and gray wings and tail and a dark one which is uniformly gray though similar in appearance to gulls fulmars are in fact members of the procellariidae family which include petrels and shearwatersthe northern fulmar and its sister species the southern fulmar fulmarus glacialodes are the extant members of the genus fulmarus the fulmars are in turn a member of the order procellariiformes and they all share certain identifying features first they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns however nostrils on albatrosses are on the sides of the bill as opposed to the rest of the order including fulmars which have nostrils on top of the upper bill the bills of procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates one of these plates makes up the hooked portion of the upper bill called the maxillary unguis they produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus this can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defense against predators from a very early age and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights 6  it will mat the plumage of avian predators and can lead to their death 7  finally they also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage that helps desalinate their bodies due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe this gland excretes a high saline solution from their nose 7 the northern fulmar was first described as fulmarus glacialis by carl linnaeus in 1761 based on a specimen from within the arctic circle on spitsbergen 4 subspecies edit the northern fulmar consists of three sub species 8 etymology edit fulmarus glacialis can be broken down to the old norse word full meaning foul and mar meaning gull foul gull is in reference to its stomach oil and also its superficial similarity to seagulls finally glacialis is latin for glacial because of its extreme northern range 9 description edit the northern fulmar has a wingspan of 102 to 112 cm 40–44 in 4  and is 46 cm 18 in in length 10  11  12  body mass can range from 450 to 1000 g 16 to 35 oz 13  this species is gray and white with a pale yellow thick bill and bluish legs 14  however there is both a light morph and dark or blue morph in the pacific ocean there is an intermediate morph as well all morphs have certain similarities such as only the dark morph has more than dark edges on the underneath and they all have pale inner primaries on the top of the wings the pacific morph has a darker tail than the atlantic morph 4  10  11  14  15  16  17 like other petrels their walking ability is limited but they are strong fliers with a stiff wing action quite unlike the gulls they look bull necked compared to gulls and have short stubby bills 14  they are long lived with a lifespan of 31 years not uncommon 18 population and trends 19 locationbreeding populationwinter populationbreeding

dive up to several feet deep to retrieve their prey 12 breeding edit nesting in shetland scotlandnests in county mayo irelanda fulmar flying in kongsfjord ny alesund svalbardthe northern fulmar starts breeding at between six and twelve years old it is monogamous and forms long term pair bonds it returns to the same nest site year after year 7  the breeding season starts in may 4  however the female has glands that store sperm to allow weeks to pass between copulation and the laying of the egg 7  their nest is a scrape on a grassy ledge or a saucer of vegetation on the ground lined with softer material the birds nest in large colonies 4  7  12  15  16  recently they have started nesting on rooftops and buildings 4  both sexes are involved in the nest building process 7  a single white egg 61 mm 240 in in size 7  is incubated for a period of 50 to 54 days by both sexes the altricial chick is brooded for 2 weeks and fully fledges after 70 to 75 days again both sexes are involved 4  7  during this period the parents are nocturnal and will not even be active on well lit nights 7 social behavior edit the mating ritual of this fulmar consists of the female resting on a ledge and the male landing with his bill open and his head back he commences to wave his head side to side and up and down while calling 7 they make grunting and chuckling sounds while eating and guttural calls during the breeding season 15  16 conservation edit the northern fulmar is estimated to have between 15000000 and 30000000 mature individuals that occupy an occurrence range of 28400000 km2 11000000 sq mi and their north american population is on the rise hence it is listed with the iucn as least concern 19  the range of these species increased greatly last century due to the availability of fish offal from commercial fleets but may contract because of less food from this source and climatic change 4  the population increase has been especially notable in the british isles

gadwall   wikipedia the gadwall anas strepera is one of the most common and widespread dabbling ducks 2  in the family anatidae it usually frequents wetlands and dabbles for foodtaxonomy edit the gadwall was first described by linnaeus in 1758 in his systema naturae under its current scientific name 3  dna studies have shown that it is a sister species with the falcated duck and that these two are closely related to the wigeons 4  there two subspecies 5 a s strepera described by linnaeus is the nominate subspeciesa s couesi coues gadwall extinct circa 1874 was formerly found on teraina a coral atoll in the pacific ocean 6 anas is the latin for duck and strepera is late latin for noisy 7  the etymology of the word gadwall is not known but the name has been in use since 1666 8 description edit the gadwall is 46–56 cm 18–22 in long with a 78–90 cm 31–35 in wingspan 9  the male is slightly larger than the female weighing on average 990 g 35 oz against her 850 g 30 oz 10  the breeding male is patterned grey with a black rear end light chestnut wings and a brilliant white speculum obvious in flight or at rest 11  in non breeding eclipse plumage the drake looks more like the female but retains the male wing pattern and is usually greyer above and has less orange on the bill 10 the female is light brown with plumage much like a female mallard it can be distinguished from that species by the dark orange edged bill smaller size the white speculum and white belly 11  both sexes go through two moults annually following a juvenile moult 9 the gadwall is a quieter duck except during its courtship display females give a call similar to the quack of a female mallard but higher pitched transcribed as gag ag ag ag males give a grunt transcribed as nheck and a whistle 10 distribution edit the gadwall breeds in the northern areas of europe and asia and central north america in north america its breeding range lies along the saint lawrence river through the great lakes alberta saskatchewan the dakotas south to kansas west to california and along coastal pacific canada and southern coastal alaska 9  11  the range of this bird appears to be expanding into eastern north america this dabbling duck is strongly migratory and winters farther south than its breeding range from coastal alaska south into central america and east into idaho kansas ohio virginia and then south all the way into central america 9  11 in great britain the gadwall is a scarce breeding bird and winter visitor though its population has increased in recent years it is likely that its expansion was partly through introduction mainly to england and partly through colonization to great britain with continental birds staying to breed in scotland it has been reported in the river avon in hampshire and wiltshire in ireland a small breeding population has recently become established centred on wexford in the south and lough neagh in the north 12 behaviour edit the gadwall is a bird of open wetlands such as prairie or steppe lakes wet grassland or marshes with dense fringing vegetation and usually feeds by dabbling for plant food with head submerged it nests on the ground often some distance from water it is not as gregarious as some dabbling ducks outside the breeding season and tends to form only small flocks this is a fairly quiet species the male has a hoarse whistling call and the female has a mallard like quack the young birds are fed insects at first adults also eat some molluscs and insects during the nesting season the gadwall is one of the species to which the agreement on the conservation of african eurasian migratory waterbirds aewa appliesconservation edit currently the gadwall is listed under least concern lc in the iucn red list of threatened species 1  populations have increased approximately 25 over the course of 49 years from 1966 to 2010 and continue to grow gadwalls are one of the most hunted duck species 3rd to the mallard and green winged teal with 17 million shot each year since the efforts of ducks unlimited and other private conservation groups the species continues to be sustainably hunted 2 gallery edit references edit  a b

american goldfinch   wikipedia the american goldfinch spinus tristis also known as the eastern goldfinch or lightning bird is a small north american bird in the finch family it is migratory ranging from mid alberta to north carolina during the breeding season and from just south of the canada–united states border to mexico during the winterthe only finch in its subfamily to undergo a complete molt the american goldfinch displays sexual dimorphism in its coloration the male is a vibrant yellow in the summer and an olive color during the winter while the female is a dull yellow brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer the male displays brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a matethe american goldfinch is a granivore and adapted for the consumption of seedheads with a conical beak to remove the seeds and agile feet to grip the stems of seedheads while feeding it is a social bird and will gather in large flocks while feeding and migrating it may behave territorially during nest construction but this aggression is short lived its breeding season is tied to the peak of food supply beginning in late july which is relatively late in the year for a finch this species is generally monogamous and produces one brood each yearhuman activity has generally benefited the american goldfinch it is often found in residential areas attracted to bird feeders which increase its survival rate in these areas deforestation also creates open meadow areas which are its preferred habitattaxonomy edit the american goldfinch was one of the many species originally described by linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his work systema naturae 3  it was initially included in the genus spinus a group containing new world goldfinches and siskins but in 1976 spinus was merged into the genus carduelis as a subgenus 4  recent studies resurrect the genus spinus its closest relatives are the lesser goldfinch s psaltria lawrences goldfinch s lawrencei and the siskins although it shares a name with the european goldfinch the two are in separate subgenera and are not directly related 5  carduelis is derived from carduus the latin word for thistle the species name tristis is latin for sorrowful 6  there are four recognized subspecies of the american goldfinch 7 s t tristis is the most common of the subspecies its summer range is from southern canada to colorado and east to the carolinas its winter range is from southern canada south to florida and central mexico 8 s t pallidus is differentiated from other subspecies by its paler body color stronger white markings and in males a larger black cap it is slightly larger than c t tristis the summer range is from british columbia to western ontario south to colorado and west to oregon in winter the range extends from southern canada and northern california south to mexico 8 s t jewetti is smaller and darker than the other subspecies it occurs on the coastal slope of the cascade mountains from southern british columbia to central california overlapping with the range of c t pallidus 8 s t salicamans occurs west of the sierra nevada range during the summer and in south and central baja california peninsula to the mojave desert and colorado desert in winter in winter the plumage of both sexes is browner than other subspecies and in summer the males black cap is smaller than that of other subspecies 8  this subspecies has been called the willow goldfinch 9 this seems to be the most ancient extant species of the meso american spinuscarduelis evolutive radiation whose parental species is carduelisspinus lawrencei 10  11  12 description edit the american goldfinch is a small finch 11–14 cm 43–55 in long with a wingspan of 19–22 cm 75–87 in it weighs between 11–20 g 039–071 oz 13  among standard measurements the wing chord is 65 to 78 cm 26 to 31 in the tail is 42 to 51 cm 17 to 20 in the culmen is 09 to 11 cm 035 to 043 in and the tarsus is 12 to 14 cm 047 to 055 in 14  the beak is small conical and pink for most of the year but turns bright orange with the spring molt in both sexes 15  the shape and size of the beak aid in the extraction of seeds from the seed heads of thistles sunflowers and other plants 16 the american goldfinch undergoes a molt in the spring and autumn it is the only cardueline finch to undergo a molt twice a year 17  during the winter molt it sheds all its feathers in the spring it sheds all but the wing and tail feathers which are dark brown in the female and black in the male 16  the markings on these feathers remain through each molt with bars on the wings and white under and at the edges of the short notched tail 15  the sexual dimorphism displayed in plumage coloration is especially pronounced after the spring molt when the bright color of the males summer plumage is needed to attract a mate 16 once the spring molt is complete the body of the male is a brilliant lemon yellow a color produced by carotenoid pigments from plant materials in its diet 18  with a striking jet black cap and white rump that is visible during flight 19  the female is mostly brown lighter on the underside with a yellow bib 17  after the autumn molt the bright summer feathers are replaced by duller plumage becoming buff below and olive brown above with a pale yellow face and bib the autumn plumage is almost identical in both sexes but the male has yellow shoulder patches 20  in some winter ranges the goldfinches lose all traces of yellow becoming a predominantly medium tan gray color with an olive tinge evident only on close viewingthe immature american goldfinch has a dull brown back and the underside is pale yellow the shoulders and tail are dull black with buff colored rather than white markings on wings and rump this coloration is the same in both genders 20 the song of the american goldfinch is a series of musical warbles and twitters often with a long note a tsee tsi tsi tsit call is often given in flight it may also be described as per chic o ree 15  while the female incubates the eggs she calls to her returning mate with a soft continuous teeteeteeteete sound the young begin to use a call of chick kee or chick wee shortly before fledging which they use until they have left the nest entirely 16  there are two defense calls made by adults during nesting a sweeet call made to rally other goldfinches to the nest and distract predators and a bearbee used to signal to the nestlings to quiet them and get them to crouch down in the nest to become less conspicuous 21 distribution and habitat edit female american goldfinchthe american goldfinch prefers open country where weeds thrive such as fields meadows flood plains as well as roadsides orchards and gardens it may also be found in open deciduous and riparian woodlands and areas of secondary growth 22  this habitat preference continues during the spring and autumn migrations 15 the summer breeding range stretches across north america from coast to coast it is bounded on the north by saskatchewan and stretches south across north america to north carolina on the east coast and northern california on the west coast 15  the american goldfinch is a short distance migrant moving south in response to colder weather and lessened food supply the migration is completed in compact flocks which travel in an erratic wavelike flight pattern 23 its winter range includes southern canada and stretches south through the united states to parts of mexico in winter in the northern part of its range the finch may move nearer to feeders if they are available in southern ranges during winter they remain in areas similar to the fields and flood plains where they live during the summer months 24 attempts were made to introduce the american goldfinch into bermuda in the 19th century and tahiti in 1938 but the species failed to become established 25 behavior edit male left and female right at a thistle feederthe american goldfinch flies in a distinctive undulating pattern creating a wave shaped path this normally consists of a series of wing beats to lift the bird then folding in the wings and gliding in an arc before repeating the pattern birds often vocalize during the flapping phase of the pattern and then go silent during the coasting phase the call made during flight is per twee twee twee or ti di di di punctuated by the silent periods 24  26 the american goldfinch is gregarious during the non breeding season when it is often found in large flocks usually with other finches during the breeding season it lives in loose colonies while the nest is being constructed the male will act aggressively toward other males who intrude into his territory driving them away and the female reacts in the same way toward other females this aggressiveness subsides once the eggs have been laid 27 the american goldfinch does not act aggressively toward predators within its territory its only reaction is alarm calling predators include snakes weasels squirrels and blue jays which may destroy eggs or kill young and hawks and cats which pose a threat to both young and adults as of 2007 the oldest known american goldfinch was 10 years and 5 months old 28 male perched on a thistle plantamerican goldfinches eating sunflower headsthe american goldfinch is a diurnal feeder according to the cornell lab of ornithology the species is one of the strictest vegetarians in the bird world 28  it is mainly granivorous but will occasionally eat insects which are also fed to its young to provide protein its diet consists of the seeds from a wide variety of annual plants often those of weeds grasses and trees such as thistle teasel dandelion ragweed mullein cosmos goatsbeard sunflower and alder 22  however it also consumes tree buds maple sap and berries it will eat at bird feeders provided by humans particularly in the winter months preferring niger seed commonly and erroneously called thistle seed 29 unlike some finch species the american goldfinch uses its feet extensively in feeding it frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding in order to reach the seeds more easily in the spring the american goldfinch feeds on the catkins hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch this dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors increasing its chances of survival 16 reproduction edit the american goldfinch begins its breeding season later in the year than any other finch and later than any other native north american bird besides occasionally the sedge wren 16  28  this may be related to the abundance of seeds in the late summer months as seeds represent the majority of their diet 27 the courtship rituals of the american goldfinch include aerial maneuvers and singing by males who begin courtship in late july the flight displays begin as the male pursues the female who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns the male is able to signal his quality and fitness both in the short term current body condition and long term genes through ornamentation bill color and plumage 30  if a female accepts the male as a mate the pair will fly in wide circles as the male warbles throughout the flight 16 once a male has found a mate he selects a territory marking the boundaries by warbling as he flies from perch to perch after circling the perimeter he performs two flight displays first repeating a low flat flight then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight tucking his wings close to his body plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward in a series of loops two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony perhaps to aid in defense against predators 16 nest of an american goldfinchthe nest is built in late summer by the female in the branches of a deciduous shrub or tree at a height of up to 10 m 33 ft the nest building lasts approximately six days during which time the female works in 10–40 minute increments the male frequently flies with the female as she collects nesting materials and though he may carry some materials back to the nest he leaves its construction to the female the outer shell of the nest is built of bark weeds vines and grass 23  the inside diameter of the finished nest is about 65 cm 26 in 22  the rim is reinforced with bark bound by spiderwebs and caterpillar silk and the cup is lined with plant down from milkweed thistle or cattail the nest is so tightly woven that it can hold water and it is possible for nestlings to drown following a rainstorm if the parents do not cover the nest 17 american goldfinches lay four to six bluish white eggs which are oval in shape and about 16 mm × 12 mm 063 in × 047 in roughly the size of a peanut 23  it is thought that they are laid during the night 24  the eggs are incubated by the female alone though the male brings her food as she nests and most mating pairs raise only one brood each year 23 the chicks hatch 12–14 days after incubation begins like all passerines the chicks are altricial they are born naked with reddish bodies pale grey down and closed eyes 31  the mother bird feeds her young regurgitated seeds and insects as they grow 19  the hatchlings develop quickly opening their eyes after three days and completing the growth of olive brown juvenile plumage after 11–15 days at which time they begin to practice short flights close to the nest for up to three weeks after fledging they are still fed by the male who locates them by listening for their fledging call the chicks stop giving this call when they become entirely independent 16 american goldfinches are occasionally victims of brood parasites particularly brown headed cowbirds one study found that 9 of nests had brown headed cowbird eggs in them 32  american goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites with studies showing low hatching rates of brown headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success this is despite the fact that the american goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites it is thought that the inability of brown headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough nutrition the seed rich diet of american goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect rich diet of other hosts 33 relationship with humans edit the american goldfinch is found in residential areas throughout its range backyard birders attract it using feeders containing nyjer thistle seed 29  or by planting grasses and perennial plants such as zinnias cosmos bee balm or globe thistle which produce seedheads favored by finches although some controversy surrounds bird feeding see bird feeder for details an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species 29 the american goldfinch is not threatened by human activity and is widespread throughout its range 1  7  the clearing of forests by humans though harmful to many species has benefited the american goldfinch clearing of woodlands causes declines in numbers of neotropical migrants while favoring short distance migrants and permanent residents 34  this benefits the american goldfinch both as a short distance migrant and because the created open areas are the preferred environment of the bird where weeds thrive which produce the primary food source of the american goldfinch 17 state bird edit the american goldfinch is the state bird of iowa and new jersey where it is called the eastern goldfinch and washington where it is called the willow goldfinch 35  it was chosen by schoolchildren

european goldfinch   wikipedia c c britannica in the ukthe european goldfinch or goldfinch carduelis carduelis is a small passerine bird in the finch family that is native to europe north africa and western asia it has been introduced to other areas including australia new zealand and uruguaythe goldfinch has a red face and a black and white head the back and flanks are buff or chestnut brown the black wings have a broad yellow bar the tail is black and the rump is white the female is very similar to the male but has a slightly smaller red area on the facethe goldfinch is often depicted in italian renaissance paintings of the madonna and childtaxonomy edit the goldfinch was described and illustrated by swiss naturalist conrad gesner in his historiae animalium of 1555 2  in 1758 linnaeus included the species in the 10th edition of his systema naturae under its current binomial name carduelis carduelis 3  4  carduelis is the classical latin word for a goldfinch 5  modern molecular genetic studies have shown that the european goldfinch is most closely related to the citril finch carduelis citrinella and the corsican finch carduelis corsicana 6 the english word goldfinch was used in the second half of the 14th century by geoffrey chaucer in his unfinished the cooks tale gaillard he was as goldfynch in the shawe gaily dressed he was as is a goldfinch in the woods 7 subspecies edit the subspecies are divided into two major groups these intergrade at their boundary so the groups are not recognised as distinct species despite their readily distinguishable plumage subspecies in the carduelis group occupy the western part of the range and have black crowns subspecies in the caniceps group occupy the eastern part of the range and have grey heads 8  9 carduelis groupc c

weight of 14 to 19 g 049 to 067 oz the sexes are broadly similar with a red face black and white head warm brown upperparts white underparts with buff flanks and breast patches and black and yellow wingson closer inspection male goldfinches can often be distinguished by a larger darker red mask that extends just behind the eye in females the red face does not extend past the eye the ivory coloured bill is long and pointed and the tail is forked goldfinches in breeding condition have a white bill with a greyish or blackish mark at the tip for the rest of the year juveniles have a plain head and a greyer back but are unmistakable due to the yellow wing stripe birds in central asia caniceps group have a plain grey head behind the red face lacking the black and white head pattern of european and western asian birds 10  11 the song is a pleasant silvery twittering the call is a melodic tickelit and the song is a pleasant tinkling medley of trills and twitters but always including the trisyllabic call phrase or a tellit tellit tellitdistribution and habitat edit the goldfinch is native to europe north africa and western and central asia it is found in open partially wooded lowlands and is a resident in the milder west of its range but migrates from colder regions it will also make local movements even in the west to escape bad weather it has been introduced to many areas of the world 12  it was introduced to canada united states mexico peru argentina chile the falkland islands uruguay brazil south africa australia and new zealand 13  in the 19th century and their populations quickly increased and their range expanded greatly they now occur from brisbane to the eyre peninsula in australia and throughout new zealand 14 behaviour and ecology edit breeding edit the nest is built entirely by the female and is generally completed within a week the male accompanies the female but does not contribute the nest is neat and compact and is generally located several meters above the ground hidden by leaves in the twigs at the end of a swaying branch 16  it is constructed of mosses and lichens and lined with plant down such as that from thistles it is attached to the twigs of the tree with spider silk a deep cup prevents the loss of eggs in windy weather 17  beginning within a couple of days after the completion of the nest the eggs are laid in early morning at daily intervals 15  the clutch is typically 4 6 eggs which are whitish with reddish brown speckles 16  they have a smooth surface and are slightly glossy 15  the average size is 173 mm × 130 mm 068 in × 051 in with a calculated weight of 153 g 0054 oz 15  the eggs are incubated for 11–13 days by the female who is fed by the male the chicks are fed by both parents initially they receive a mixture of seeds and insects but as they grow the proportion of insect material decreases 18  for the first 7–9 days the young are brooded by the female the nestlings fledge 13–18 days after hatching the young birds are fed by both parents for a further 7–9 days the parents typically raise two brood each year and occasionally three 15 feeding edit the goldfinchs preferred food is small seeds such as those from thistles the latin name is from carduus a genus of thistles and teasels but insects are also taken when feeding young it also regularly visits bird feeders in winter in the winter goldfinches group together to form flocks of up to forty occasionally more goldfinches are attracted to back gardens in europe and north america by birdfeeders containing niger commercially described as nyjer seed this seed of an annual from south asia is small and high in oils special polycarbonate feeders with small oval slits at which the goldfinches feed are sometimes usedrelationships with humans edit goldfinches are commonly kept and bred in captivity around the world because of their distinctive appearance and pleasant song in britain during the 19th century many thousands of goldfinches were trapped each year to be sold as cage birds one of the earliest campaigns of the society for the protection of birds was directed against this trade 19  the goldfinch males are sometimes crossed with canary females with the intention to produce male mules with beautiful singing voices that often capture the best singing attributes of both breedschristian symbolism edit because of the thistle seeds it eats in christian symbolism the goldfinch is associated with christs passion and his crown of thorns the goldfinch appearing in pictures of the madonna and christ child represents the foreknowledge jesus and mary had of the crucifixion examples include the madonna del cardellino or madonna of the goldfinch painted by the italian renaissance artist raphael in about 1505–6 in which john the baptist offers the goldfinch to christ in warning of his future in baroccis holy family a goldfinch is held in the hand of john the baptist who holds it high out of reach of an interested cat in cima da coneglianos madonna and child a goldfinch flutters in the hand of the christ child it is also an emblem of endurance fruitfulness and persistence because it symbolizes the passion the goldfinch is considered a saviour bird and may be pictured with the common fly which represents sin and disease 20  the goldfinch is also associated with saint jerome and appears in some depictions of him 20 depictions in art edit antonio vivaldi composed a concerto in d major for flute il gardellino rv 428 op 10 no 3 where the singing of the goldfinch is imitated by a

horned grebe   wikipedia the horned grebe or slavonian grebe podiceps auritus is a relatively small waterbird in the family podicipedidae there are two known subspecies p a auritus which breeds in eurasia and p a cornutus which breeds in north america 2  in eurasia the subspecies is distributed over most of northern europe and asia breeding from greenland to western china 3  the north american subspecies spans most of canada and some of the united states 3  both subspecies appear physically similar and get their name from large patches of yellowish feathers called “horns” located behind the eyes that can raise and lower at willdescription edit birders can easily recognize the horned grebe by its red and black alternate breeding plumage its black and white basic non breeding plumage and its characteristic “horns” this small grebe is 31–38 cm long has a wingspan 55–74 cm wide and weighs 300 570 g 3  it has a moderately long neck flat forehead and a rear crown of black feathers its beak is straight and pointy with a white tip both subspecies are physically similar except pa auritius eurasia appears darker than pacornutus north america which has light grey feathers on its back inconspicuous or absent in paauritius 4  the horned grebe is often confused with the eared grebe which is similar in size and colouring but differentiates by a steeper forehead a more slender bill and a fluffier rump 5 the alternate breeding plumage of the horned grebe has bright erectable “horns” black fan shaped cheek feathers and an overall red and black colour the neck flanks lores and upper chest are chestnut brown while the crown and back are black the belly is a dull white males are slightly larger and brighter than females but are generally indistinguishablethe basic non breeding plumage is overall black and white the neck chest and cheeks are white while the back and crown are a dull black grey the border between the crown and the cheeks extend in a straight line behind the eyes the basic plumage does not have “horns”horned grebe basic nonbreeding plumagejuveniles appear similar to a non breeding adult except they are a slightly duller shade of white and their back is tinged with brown the line separating the cheeks and crown is less distinct and their beak is paler 6  the chicks are fluffy with a dull grey back a white belly and interesting black and white facial

northwestern region of the continent with 92 of its distribution located in canada 5  the total north american range spans from south central alaska to northwestern ontario 3  it breeds as far north as the yukon and southern nunavut to northwestern states from washington to minnesota 3  additionally there is small population who breed annually on the magdalene islands of quebec 9  its wintering range is also primarily coastal from southern alaska down to the northern gulf of california 3  its eastern overwintering range is from southern nova scotia down to the florida keys and sometimes west to texas 2 horned grebes breed primarily in temperate zones including prairies and parklands but are also seen in boreal and subarctic regions 3  they breed in small to moderately sized 05 10 ha shallow freshwater ponds marshes and shallow bays on lake edges with beds of emergent vegetation 5  they prefer areas with sedges rushes and cattails along with large areas of open water 10  this habitat provides a suitable site for nest material anchorage concealment and protection for youngchicks swimming along side adult in alternate plumageduring migration they will stop along lakes rivers and marshes following migration they winter in marine environments of estuaries and bays or inland on large lakes although in norway large concentrations congregate on inland lakes 8 behaviour edit vocalization edit young begin calling for begging purposes in a slightly trill peeping noise similar to that of a domestic chick as they mature their song changes to a more adult like chittering 11  their typical advertising call is loud and nasaly “aaarrh” descending in a pitch and ending in a trill 7  they use other calls during copulation alarm and breeding ceremonies that are slightly variable from the advertising call horned grebes are extremely vocal during breeding territory establishment and defense 3  their song is subdued during fall migration and at wintering sites 7 horned grebes dive underwater using their large feet for agile manoeuvrability to feed on aquatic arthropods fish and crustaceans 3  otherwise will catch airborne insects at water surface underwater they swallow or capture large prey remerging at the surface to manipulate the fish headfirst 12  they usually feed solitarily or in small groups up to 5 individuals 12  during the summer aquatic and airborne arthropods are preferred whereas winter selection favours fish and crustaceans 3 the horned grebe has a unique adaptation for swallowing fish whole they will eat their own feathers from a young age so their stomach has a matted plug that functions as a filter to hold fish bones until digestion 7 reproduction edit horned grebes are monogamous and develop their relationship through elaborate mating routines there are four pair bonding ceremonies discovery ceremony weed ceremony head shaking ceremony and triumph ceremony 11  12  13  the discovery ceremony begins with advertising displays which include an upright posture erect “horns” and sounding of their advertising call then both male and female engage in bouts of penguin dance and preening this initial pair bonding ceremony is to ensure correct species identification sex and compatibility 12  the weed ceremony follows the completion of a successful discovery ceremony the male and female will dive retrieve weeds and rise in synchronization the pair will come breast to breast with their weeds then turn side by side to continue swimming this weed rush can continue multiple times until both individuals are satisfied 12  13  finally the head shaking ceremony and triumph ceremony are preformed for primarily established pairs 11  once copulation is to take place it always occurs on a platformnest built by the pair 12  13 horned grebes usually arrive at breeding grounds in pairs or solitarily to seek out a mate between april and august 6  within a typical breeding colony there consist of approximately 20 breeding pairs who nest solitarily 3  during nesting horned grebes are known to defend their nests very aggressively 13  those nests are built from plant matter and are most commonly affixed to emergent vegetation otherwise built on land or in shallow open water in june females lay a single clutch of 3 to 8 eggs 14  which range are coloured white brownish or blueish green 3  7  both males and females share incubation time for 22 to 25 days 6  14  when the young hatch they can swim and dive within the first few days although they must be kept warm by their parents for up to 14 days 3  during this time the juvenile chicks can often be seen riding on the backs of their swimming parents right in between the wing and the back 7  later the horned grebe will take their first flight at 55–60 days old 15  the species finally reaches sexual maturity at 2 years old 6 population trends edit the total western population is estimated between 200000 and 500000 individuals 5  and the eurasian population at 12900 to 18500 mature individuals 2  the global population has been declined by 30 over the last three decades and by 79 within north america 5  this is due primarily to human disturbance forestry operations around breeding sites fluctuating water levels and stocking of lakes with rainbow trout that compete for aquatic insects 6  they are also frequently caught in nets vulnerable to oil spills and diseases 5  6  within 1985 and 2001 grassland and wetland drainage amounted to 5 global habitat loss 5  the canadian western population is listed as special concern and the breeding population on magdalene islands is listed as endangered 5  due to global declines the horned grebe has been unlisted from least concern to vulnerable resulting in conservation and

pied billed grebe   wikipedia the pied billed grebe podilymbus podiceps is a species of the grebe family of water birds since the atitlán grebe podilymbus gigas has become extinct it is the sole extant member of the genus podilymbus the pied billed grebe is primarily found in ponds throughout the americas 2  other names of this grebe include american dabchick dabchick carolina grebe devil diver dive dapper dipper hell diver pied billed dabchick pied bill thick billed grebe and water witch 3  4 taxonomy and name edit the pied billed grebe was described by carl linnaeus in the 10th edition of his systema naturae in 1758 as colymbus podiceps 5  the binomial name is derived from latin podilymbus a contraction of podicipes feet at the buttocks from podici  rump   pes foot—the origin of the name of the grebe order—and ancient greek kolymbos diver and podiceps rump headed from podici   new latin ceps 6 outside its own genus the closest relatives of the pied billed grebe are the small grebes of the genus tachybaptus 7 description edit pied billed grebes are small stocky and short necked they are 31–38 cm 12–15 in in length with a wingspan of 45–62 cm 18–24 in and weigh 253–568 g 89–200 oz 9  they are mainly brown with a darker crown and back 10  their brown color serves as camouflage in the marshes they live in 11  they do not have white under their wings when flying like other grebes 12  their undertail is white 10  and they have a short blunt chicken like bill that is a light grey color 2  10  which in summer is encircled by a broad black band hence the name in the summer its throat is black 2  there is no sexual dimorphism 12  juveniles have black and white stripes and look more like winter adults 2  this grebe does not have webbed feet its toes have lobes that come out of the side of each toe these lobes allow for easy paddling 2  when flying the feet appear behind the body due to the feets placement in the far back of the body 10 it may be confused with the least grebe although that species is much smaller and has a thinner bill other similarly sized grebes are very distinct in plumage ie the eared grebe and horned grebe both species bear much more colorful breeding plumage with rufous sides golden crests along the side of the head against contrasting slaty color also a rufous neck in the horned while in winter both the eared and horned grebes are pied with slaty and cream color and have red eyesvocalization edit its call is unique loud and sounds like a whooping kuk kuk cow cow cow cowp cowp 13  its call is similar to the yellow billed cuckoo 11 distribution and habitat edit they are most commonly found throughout north america central america and south america year round during the summer breeding season they are most prevalent in central northern and northeastern canada 2  if they live in an area where the water freezes in the winter they will migrate migrating birds generally meet with year round birds in september and october 14  they migrate at night 2  most migratory birds leave in march or april 14  they make occasional appearances in europe and hawaii 2  in the united kingdom pied billed grebe visits have numbered 37 sightings as of 2007 appearing generally in october to january 15  one bird in england bred with a little grebe producing hybrid young 16  it is the only grebe on record to have visited the galapagos islands 17 pied billed grebes are found in freshwater wetlands with emergent vegetation such as cattails 13  they are occasionally found in salt water when breeding they are found in emergent vegetation near open water and in the winter they are primarily found in open water due to the lack of nests to maintain they may live near rivers but prefer still water they may be found in higher elevations when migrating 14  they will breed in restored and man made wetlands 14 pied billed grebes live approximately 10–12 years 12 behaviour edit pied billed grebes rarely fly they make a slow dive frequently especially when in danger diving to about 20 ft 61 m or less 2  12  they dive for about 30 seconds and may move to a more secluded area of the water allowing only the head to be visible to watch the danger dissipate 12  this frequency in diving has earned them the description of being reclusive or shy in nature 13  it has also earned them nicknames like hell diver 3  they rarely spend time in flocks 14  their courtship include calling and sometimes duets 14  males will show territorial behaviour if another male is at the edge of his territory they face each other and then turn their heads and bills up then they turn away and start calling then they turn back around to look at one another 12 breeding edit the pied billed grebe breeds in south central canada throughout the united states central america the caribbean and temperate south america 9  these grebes may lay up to two sets of eggs a year 12  their nests sit on top of the water their eggs sitting in vegetation that resides in the water 13  grebes lay between three and ten bluish white smooth elliptical eggs with the female starting the incubation process 2  12  they are incubated for around 23 days by both parents with the female taking over incubation duties towards the end of that time period 12  14  they will cover the nest with nesting material if they have to leave it for an extended period of time 14 young grebes may leave the nest within one day of hatching they are downy at birth yellow skin is seen between the lore and top of the head 12  they do not swim well and stay out of the water they sleep on their parents backs within four weeks they start swimming 2  when alerted they will climb on the back of a parent grebe and eventually mature to dive under the water like their parents 2  13  both parents share the role of raising the young – both feeding and carrying them on their backs 14  sometimes the parents will dive underwater to get food with the chicks on their backs 12 adult with two juveniles feeding on a crawfishpied billed grebes feed mainly on aquatic invertebrates and also on small fish and amphibians frogs tadpoles they dive to obtain food 2  their bills allow them to crush crustaceans like crawfish 2  14  they may also eat plants 4  they have been shown to eat their own feathers like other grebes to aid in digestion prevent injury from small bones 18  they will also feed their feathers to their young 14 threats edit they are extremely sensitive to disturbances especially by humans while breeding if scared adults may abandon their nests without protecting the eggs the waves from boats can destroy the nests and their sounds easily frighten the birds 11 in culture edit pied billed grebe feathers are thick and soft their feathers were formerly used as decorations on hats and earmuffs and they were hunted in the eastern united states in the 19th century 11  12 the grebes are declining in new england the reasons are unknown 14  the states of connecticut and new hampshire have declared the pied billed grebe as endangered in new jersey 11  and massachusetts they have been declared threatened in vermont they are of special concern in rhode island they are locally extinct 12 habitat loss is the grebes biggest threat the draining filling and general destruction of wetlands causes a loss in their breeding habitats 11  however they are still common in the majority of their distribution areas 14 references edit  birdlife international 2012 podilymbus podiceps iucn red list of threatened species version 20132

pine grosbeak   wikipedia the pine grosbeak pinicola enucleator is a large member of the true finch family fringillidae it is found in coniferous woods across alaska the western mountains of the united states canada and in subarctic fennoscandia and siberia the species is a frugivore especially in winter favoring small fruits such as rowans mountain ashes in the new world with fruit crop abundance varying from year to year pine grosbeak is one of many subarctic resident bird species that exhibit irruptive behavior in irruption years individuals can move long distances in search of suitable food supplies bringing them farther south andor downslope than is typical of years with large fruit crops in such years in the new world they may occur well south of the typical extent of winter distribution which is the northern great lakes region and northern new england in the united states this species is a very rare vagrant to temperate europe in all of germany for example not more than 4 individuals and often none at all have been recorded each year since 1980 2 description edit eggs of pinicola enucleator mhntthis species is one of the largest species in the true finch family it measures from 20 to 255 cm 79 to 100 in in length and weighs from 52 to 78 g 18 to 28 oz with an average mass of 564 g 199 oz among standard measurements the wing chord is 102 to 116 cm 40

wing bars and a large bill adult males have a rose red head back and rump adult females are olive yellow on the head and rump and grey on the back and underparts young birds have a less contrasting plumage overall appearing shaggy when they moult their colored head plumageits voice is geographically variable and includes a whistled pui pui pui or chii vli the song is a short musical warbleecology edit the breeding habitat of the pine grosbeak is coniferous forests they nest on a horizontal branch or in a fork of a conifer this bird is a permanent resident through most of its range in the extreme north or when food sources are scarce they may migrate farther southpine grosbeaks forage in trees and bushes they mainly eat seeds buds berries and insects outside of the nesting season they often feed in flockssystematics and evolution edit the scientific name is from latin the genus pinicola is from pinus pine tree and colere to dwell and the specific enucleator is from enucleare to remove the kernel nucleus  6 the pine grosbeak together with its himalayan relative the crimson browed finch p subhimachala represents an ancient divergence from the same stock that also gave rise to the true bullfinches pyrrhula the pinicola lineage diverged from its relatives perhaps a dozen million years ago during the clarendonian faunal stage of the mid miocene 7  8  across the species range nine subspecies have been described with the five new world forms having differing plumages and vocalizations suggesting genetic divergence within the new world perhaps to species levelat the same time the evolutionary radiation of pyrrhula throughout eurasia and the holarctic expansion of the closely related leucosticte mountain finches and relatives began these genera evolved in the interior of asia and thus the original pinicola stock was probably already a conifer forest bird living to the north of the himalayas the separation of the modern species is likely the result of climate change which displaced pinicola habitat to subarctic northern and subalpine himalayan regions possibly the ancestors of the north american pine grosbeaks were wind blown individuals which arrived via the northern pacific as the bering land bridge was generally submerged in the late miocene 7  8 according to studies by arnaiz villena et al all birds belonging to the genus pyrrhula have a common ancestor pinicola enucleator 8  9 references edit  birdlife international 2012 pinicola enucleator iucn red list of threatened species version 20132 international union for conservation of

rose breasted grosbeak   wikipedia the rose breasted grosbeak pheucticus ludovicianus is a large seed eating grosbeak in the cardinal family cardinalidae it is primarily a foliage gleaner it breeds in cool temperate north america migrating to tropical america in winteretymology edit the genus name pheucticus is from ancient greek pheuktiko  shy from pheugo  to flee and the specific ludovicianus is from new latin and refers to louisiana 2 description edit adult birds are 18–22 cm 71–87 in long span 29–33 cm 11–13 in across the wings and weigh 35–65 g 12–23 oz 3  4  grosbeaks measured during migration in the west indies averaged 43 g 15 oz while those banded in pennsylvania average about 45 g 16 oz 5  6  there is very little sexual dimorphism in size females were found to be marginally smaller in standard measurements but in some seasons were marginally heavier than males when banded in pennsylvania 6  7  8  at all ages and in both sexes the beak is dusky horn colored and the feet and eyes are dark 9 the adult male in breeding plumage has a black head wings back and tail and a bright rose red patch on its breast the wings have two white patches and rose red linings its underside and rump are white males in nonbreeding plumage have largely white underparts supercilium and cheeks the upperside feathers have brown fringes most wing feathers white ones giving a scaly appearance the bases of the primary remiges are also white the coloration renders the adult male rose breasted grosbeak even while wintering unmistakable if seen wellthe adult female has dark grey brown upperparts – darker on wings and tail – a white supercilium a buff stripe along the top of the head and black streaked white underparts which except in the center of the belly have a buff tinge the wing linings are yellowish and on the upperwing there are two white patches like in the summer male immatures are similar but with pink wing linings and less prominent streaks and usually a pinkish buff hue on the throat and breast at one year of age—in their first breeding season—males are scaly above like fully adult males in winter plumage and still retail the immatures browner wings unlike males females can easily be confused with the black headed grosbeak pheucticus melanocephalus where their ranges overlap in the central united states and south central canada the rose breasted grosbeak female has slightly darker brown markings on the underside paler rather yellowish streaking on both the head and wings and paler pinkish rather than bi colored bill when compared to the female black headed grosbeak 10  a potential confusion species also is the female purple finch haemorhous purpureus but that species is noticeably smaller with a less robust bill and a notched tail 11 the song is a subdued mellow warbling resembling a more refined sweeter version of the american robins turdus migratorius males start singing early occasionally even when still in winter quarters the call is a sharp pink or pick somewhat reminiscent of a woodpecker callrange and ecology edit habitat edit the rose breasted grosbeaks breeding habitat is open deciduous woods across most of canada and the northeastern united states in particular the northern birds migrate south through the united states east of the rocky mountains to winter from central southern mexico through central america and the caribbean to peru and venezuela the southern limit of its wintering range is not well known it was for example only recorded in the serranía de las quinchas colombia in the 1990s in winter they prefer more open woodland or similar habitat with a loose growth of trees such as forest edges parks gardens and plantations ranging from sea level into the hills eg up to 5000 ft 1500 m asl in costa rica 12 migration edit the first birds leave the breeding grounds as early as august while the last ones do not return until mid late may in general however they migrate south in late september or in october and return in late april or early may it appears as if they remain on their breeding grounds longer today than they did in the early 20th century when migrants were more commonly seen in may and august than in april or september the rose breasted grosbeak occurs as a very rare vagrant in western europe  13  during breeding it is fairly territorial in winter it roams the lands in groups of about a handful of birds and sometimes in larger flocks of a dozen or morethe rose breasted grosbeak forages in shrubs or trees for insects seeds and berries also catching insects in flight and occasionally eating nectar it usually keeps to the treetops and only rarely can be seen on the ground in the winter quarters they can be attracted into parks gardens and possibly even to bird feeders by fruit like trophis racemosa other notable winter food includes jacaranda seeds and the fruits of the introduced busy lizzy impatiens walleriana 14  in grosbeaks from the north central united states and southern canada it was found 52 of the stomach contents were comprised by invertebrates predominantly beetles 193 was made up of wild fruits 157 by weed seeds 65 by cultivated fruits and plants including peas corn zea mays oats avena sativa and wheat triticum vulgare and the remaining 65 by other plant material including tree buds and flowers 15 reproductive biology edit rose breasted grosbeaks were the only one of 70 migratory songbird species in the eastern united states shown in males to have produced sperm while still far south of their breeding location 16  male grosbeaks tend to arrive a few days to a week before the females and pair formation apparently occurs on the breeding grounds 17  nest building begins from as early as early may in tennessee to as late as early june further north in saskatchewan 18  19  egg laying may occur anytime from mid may to mid july as has been recorded in quebec 20  usually only a single brood is laid by these grosbeaks each summer but second broods are suspected in canada and confirmed in semi captivity 21  22  both the male and the female apparently participate in selecting and building the nest which is on a tree branch over vines or any elevated woody vegetation 23  nests have been recorded at 08 to 167 m 26 to 548 ft off the ground averaging 6 m 20 ft high almost always in the vicinity of openings in woodlands 24  nests are typical of many passerines in both construct material and size made from leaves twigs rootlets or hair 25  clutches are from 1 to 5 eggs normally being 3 4 being pale blue to green with purplish to brownish red spotting 26  males do a third of the incubation roughly the female doing the remaining amount and incubation can last from 11–14 days 22  nestlings are 5 g 018 oz at hatching and after 3–6 days of age they gain at least 3 g 011 oz each day 21  the young grosbeaks typically fledge at 9–13 days of age and are independent of their parents after approximately 3 weeks 21  24 longevity and mortality edit maximum lifespan recorded for a wild rose breasted grosbeak was 12 years 11 months 27  captive grosbeaks have been recorded living up to 24 years of age making them quite a long living passerine excluding the pressures of surviving in the wild 28  although frequently targeted by the brood parasite the brown headed cowbird molothrus ater the rose breasted grosbeak is apparently able to recognize cowbird eggs and has been seen to aggressively displace cowbirds near the nest 29  typically fewer than 7 of grosbeak nests have cowbird eggs per study 30  per the us bird banding laboratory as of 1997 rose breasted grosbeaks recovered dead have largely collided with objects including buildings and cars 172 or had been shot 10 mostly before 1960 36 of the fatalities were caught by cats 08 caught by dogs mortality due to natural causes including disease natural predators and inclement weather go largely unreported 31  it is known the main cause of nesting failure is predation natural predators of eggs and nestlings include blue jays cyanocitta cristata common grackles quiscalus quiscula raccoons procyon lotor gray sciurus carolinensis and red tamiasciurus hudsonicus squirrels 31  32  confirmed predators of adults include both coopers accipiter cooperii 33  and sharp shinned hawks accipiter striatus 34  as well as northern harriers circus cyaenus 35  eastern screech owls megascops asio 36  and short eared owls asio flammeus 37 status and comparative ecology edit fires are necessary to maintain many kinds of grassland see fire ecology fire suppression in the late 20th century allowed forests to spread on the great plains into areas where recurring fire would otherwise have maintained grassland this allowed hybridization with the black headed grosbeak subspecies p melanocephalus papago 38  range expansions also seem also to have occurred elsewhere for example in northern ohio where it bred rarely if at all in the 1900s decade but it by no means an uncommon breeder today in general though it requires mature woodland to breed and is occasionally caught as a cage bird the rose breasted grosbeak is not at all rare and not considered

california gull   wikipedia the california gull larus californicus is a medium sized gull smaller on average than the herring gull but larger on average than the ring billed gull though may overlap in size greatly with bothdescription edit adults are similar in appearance to the herring gull but have a smaller yellow bill with a black ring yellow legs brown eyes and a more rounded head the body is mainly white with grey back and upper wings they have black primaries with white tips immature birds are also similar in appearance to immature herring gulls with browner plumage than immature ring billed gulls length can range from 46 to 55 cm 18 to 22 in the wingspan 122–137 cm 48–54 in and body mass can vary from 430 to 1045 g 0948 to 2304 lb 2 winter plumage californiatheir breeding habitat is lakes and marshes in interior western north america from northwest territories canada south to eastern california and colorado 3  they nest in colonies sometimes with other birds the nest is a shallow depression on the ground lined with vegetation and feathers the female usually lays 2 or 3 eggs both parents feed the young birdsthey are migratory most moving to the pacific coast in winter it is only then that this bird is regularly found in western california 3 these birds forage in flight or pick up objects while swimming walking or wading they mainly eat insects fish and eggs they also scavenge at garbage dumps or docks they may follow plows in fields for insects stirred up by this activitythis is the state bird of utah 4  remembered for assisting mormon settlers in dealing with a plague of mormon crickets 5  a monument in salt lake city commemorates this event known as the miracle of the gulls 5 subspecies edit there are two subspecies recognized the nominate from the great basin to central montana and wyoming and the slightly larger paler l c albertaensis with a more northerly distribution ranging from great slave lake onto the great plains of western manitoba and south dakota 6  although these subspecies are not well distinguishable by mtdna allozyme variation 7  they breed true and the low genetic divergence can be explained by separation during the pleistocene and renewed contact in montana during more recent times 8 hand painted glass slide of a colony of california gulls at malheur lake taken by finley and bohlman during a 1908 photograph trip to the area finley and bohlmans photographs would later help malheur become a bird refuge in 1908status in california edit in california the california gull recently held the protected status california species of special concern due to declining numbers at their historic california breeding colony at mono lake however in recent decades this species has begun to breed in the southern portion of san francisco bay where it did not historically breed and has undergone exponential population growth these california gulls now inhabit large remote salt production ponds and levees and have a very large food source provided by nearby landfills from san francisco san jose and other urban areas all the way up into the sacramento area the south bay california gull population has grown from less than 1000 breeding birds in 1982 to over 33000 in 2006 this population boom has resulted in large resident flocks of gulls that will opportunistically prey on other species particularly the eggs and nestlings of other birds seriously threatened birds that share the same south bay habitat include the snowy plover and california least tern while less threatened birds including black necked stilts american avocets forsters terns and caspian terns are also preyed upon by the abnormally large flocks of california gulls efforts are underway to reduce habitat for this species and find other ways to disperse the large numbers of gulls 9 references edit  birdlife international 2012 larus californicus iucn red list of threatened species version 20132 international union for conservation of

ivory gull   wikipedia the ivory gull pagophila eburnea is a small gull the only species in the genus pagophila it breeds in the high arctic and has a circumpolar distribution through greenland northernmost north america and eurasiataxonomy edit the ivory gull was initially described by constantine phipps 2nd baron mulgrave in 1774 as larus eburneus from a specimen collected on spitsbergen 2  johann jakob kaup later recognized the unique traits of the ivory gull and gave it a monotypic genus pagophila in 1829 2  johan ernst gunnerus later gave the species a new specific name pagophila alba 2  dubious – discuss  the genus name pagophila is from ancient greek pagos sea ice and philos  loving and specific eburnea is latin for ivory coloured from ebur ivory 3  today some authors consider the ivory gull not deserving of its monotypic genus instead choosing to merge it along with the other monotypic gulls back into larus 2  however most authors have not chosen to do so the ivory gull has no subspecies 2  no fossil members of this genus are known 4 this gull has traditionally been believed to be most closely related to either the kittiwakes sabines gull or rosss gull 2  it differs anatomically from the other genera by having a relatively short tarsometatarsus a narrower os pubis and potentially more flexibility in skull kinetic structure 2  structurally it is most similar to the kittiwakes however recent genetic analysis based on mtdna sequences shows that sabines gull is the ivory gulls closest relative followed by the kittiwakes with rosss gull and swallow tailed gull sharing a clade with these species 2  5  pagophila is maintained as a unique genus because of the bird’s morphological behavioral and ecological differences from these species 2 description edit this species is easy to identify at 43 centimetres 17 in it has a different more pigeon like shape than the larus gulls but the adult has completely white plumage lacking the grey back of other gulls the thick bill is blue with a yellow tip and the legs are black its cry is a harsh eeeer young birds have a dusky face and variable amounts of black flecking in the wings and tail the juveniles take two years to attain full adult plumage there are no differences in appearance across the species’ geographic range 2 distribution and habitat edit in north america it only breeds in the canadian arctic 4  seymour island nunavut is home to the largest known breeding colony while ellesmere devon cornwallis and north baffin islands are known locations of breeding colonies 4  it is believed that there are other small breeding colonies of less than six birds that are still undiscovered 4  there are no records of the ivory gull breeding in alaska 4 during the winter ivory gulls live near polynyas or a large area of open water surrounded by sea ice 4  north american birds along with some from greenland and europe winter along the 2000 km of ice edge stretching between 50° and 64° n from the labrador sea to davis strait that is bordered by labrador and southwestern greenland 4  wintering gulls are often seen on the eastern coasts of newfoundland and labrador and occasionally appear on the north shore of the gulf of st lawrence and the interior of labrador 4  it also winters from october through june in the bering sea and chukchi seas 4  it is most widespread throughout the polynyas and pack ice of the bering sea 4  it is also vagrant throughout coastal canada and the northeastern united states though records of individuals as far south as california and georgia have been reported as well as the british isles with most records from late november through early march 4  juveniles tend to wander further from the arctic than adults 4 ecology and behavior edit ivory gulls migrate only short distances south in autumn most of the population wintering in northern latitudes at the edge of the pack ice although some birds reach more temperate areasit takes fish and crustaceans rodents eggs and small chicks but is also an opportunist scavenger often found on seal or porpoise corpses it has been known to follow polar bears and other predators to feed on the remains of their killsreproduction edit the ivory gull breeds on arctic coasts and cliffs laying one to three olive eggs in a ground nest lined with moss lichens or seaweedin 2012 the total population of ivory gulls was estimated to be between 19000 and 27000 individuals 1  the majority of these were in russia with 2500–10000 along the arctic coastline 4000 on the severnaya zemlya archipelago 6  and 8000 on franz josef land and victoria island there were also estimated to be around 4000 individuals in greenland 7  and in the years 2002–03 500–700 were recorded in canada 1  examination of data collected on an icebreaker plying between greenland and svalbard between 1988 and 2014 by claude joiris of the royal belgian institute of natural sciences found a sevenfold fall in ivory gull numbers after 2007 8  the species is rapidly declining in canada while in other parts of its range its population is poorly known the canadian population in the early 2000s were approximately 80 lower than in the 1980s 8 illegal hunting may be one of the causes of the decline in the canadian population and a second cause may be the decline in sea ice ivory gulls breed near to sea ice and the loss may make it difficult to feed their chicks 9  8 the species is classified by the international union for conservation of nature as near threatened 1 references edit  a b c d

western gull   wikipedia the western gull larus occidentalis is a large white headed gull that lives on the west coast of north america it was previously considered conspecific with the yellow footed gull larus livens of the gulf of california the western gull ranges from british columbia canada to baja california mexico 2  and because of its convenient colonies on the coast of california it is well studied despite being a well known bird species on the west coast of the us it is of some slight conservation concern given its restricted range for a gulldescription edit the western gull is a large gull that can measure 55 to 68 cm 22 to 27 in in total length spans 130 to 144 cm 51 to 57 in across the wings and weighs 800 to 1400 g 18 to 31 lb 3  4  the average mass among a survey of 48

western gull has a white head and body and gray wings it has a yellow bill with a red subterminal spot this is the small spot near the end of the bill that chicks peck in order to stimulate feeding it closely resembles the slaty backed gull larus schistisagus in the north of its range it forms a hybrid zone with its close relative the glaucous winged gull larus glaucescens western gulls take approximately four years to reach their full plumage 6  their layer of feathers and the patterns and colors on the feathers the western gull typically lives about 15 years but can live up to 25 years

territories whose borders may shift slightly from year to year but are maintained for the life of the male citation needed feeding edit western gulls feed in pelagic environments and in intertidal environments at sea they take fish 7  and invertebrates like krill squid and jellyfish they cannot dive and feed exclusively on the surface on land they feed on seal and sea lion carcasses as well as cockles starfish limpets and snails in the intertidal zone they also feed on human food refuse in human altered habitats including landfills and taking food from people at marinas and beaches at times some western gulls can be predatory preying on the young of other birds and even adults of some species one western gull at oaklands lake merritt was known for killing and eating pigeons rock doves on a daily basis western gulls will also snatch a fish from a cormorants or pelicans mouth before it is swallowedreproduction edit a nest of vegetation is constructed inside the parents territory and 3 eggs are laid these eggs are incubated for a month the chicks once hatched remain inside the territory until they have fledged chicks straying into the territory of another gull are liable to be killed by that territorys pair chick mortality is high with on average one chick surviving to fledging on occasion abandoned chicks will be adopted by other gullshybridization edit in washington state

annas hummingbird   wikipedia annas hummingbird calypte anna a medium sized hummingbird native to the west coast of north america was named after anna masséna duchess of rivoli 2  in the early 20th century annas hummingbird bred only in northern baja california and southern california the transplanting of exotic ornamental plants in residential areas throughout the pacific coast and inland deserts provided expanded nectar and nesting sites allowing the species to more extensively expand its breeding range 2  3 description edit annas hummingbird is 39 to 43 in 99 to 109 cm long it has an iridescent bronze green back a pale grey chest and belly and green flanks its bill is long straight and slender the adult male has an iridescent crimson red derived from magenta to a reddish pink crown and gorget which can look dull brown or gray without direct sunlight and a dark slightly forked tail female annas hummingbirds also have iridescent red gorgets though they are usually smaller and less brilliant than the males annas is the only north american hummingbird species with a red crown 3  females and juvenile males have a dull green crown a grey throat with or without some red iridescence a grey chest and belly and a dark rounded tail with white tips on the outer feathersthese birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue they also consume small insects and other arthropods caught in flight or gleaned from vegetation a pbs documentary shows how annas hummingbirds eat flying insects 4  they aim for the flying insect then open their beaks to capture the preywhile collecting nectar they also assist in plant pollination this species sometimes consumes tree sap 5  the males call is scratchy metallic and it perches above head level in trees and shrubs 3  they are frequently seen in backyards and parks and commonly found at feeders and flowering plantsannas hummingbirds can shake their bodies 55 times per second to shed rain while in flight 6  when done in dry weather shaking may remove pollen or dirt from feathers 6 reproduction edit open wooded or shrubby areas and mountain meadows along the pacific coast from british columbia to arizona make up c annas breeding habitat the female raises the young without the assistance of the male the female bird builds a nest in a shrub or tree in vines or attached to wires or other artificial substrates the round 38 to 51 centimetre 15 to 20 in diameter nest is constructed of plant fibers downy feathers and animal hair the exterior is camouflageed with chips of lichen plant debris and occasionally urban detritus such as paint chips and cigarette paper 2  the nest materials are bound together with spider silk they are known to nest as early as mid december and as late as june depending on geographic location and climatic conditions citation needed unlike most northern temperate hummingbirds the male annas hummingbird sings during courtship the song is thin and squeaky interspersed with buzzes and chirps and is drawn to over 10 seconds in duration during the breeding season males can be observed performing an aerial display dive over their territories the males also use the dive display to drive away rivals or intruders of other species when a female flies onto a males territory he rises up approximately 130 ft 40 m before diving over the recipient as he approaches the bottom of the dive the males reach an average speed of 27 ms 89 fts which is 385 body lengths per second 7  at the bottom of the dive the male travels 23 ms 51 mph and produces a loud sound described by some as an explosive squeak with his outer tail feathers 8  9 annas hummingbirds hybridize fairly frequently with other species especially the congeneric costas hummingbird 2  these natural hybrids have been mistaken for new species a bird allegedly collected in bolaños mexico was described and named selasphorus floresii gould 1861 or floresis hummingbird several more specimens were collected in california over a long period and the species was considered extremely rare 10  it was later determined that the specimens were the hybrid offspring of an annas hummingbird and an allens hummingbird a single bird collected in santa barbara california was described and named trochilus violajugulum jeffries 1888 or violet throated hummingbird 11  it was later determined to be a hybrid between an annas hummingbird and a black chinned hummingbird 12  13 locomotion edit during hovering flight annas hummingbirds maintain high wingbeat frequencies accomplished by their large pectoral muscles via recruitment of motor units 14  the pectoral muscles that power hummingbird flight are composed exclusively of fast glycolytic fibers that respond rapidly and are fatigue resistant 14 distribution edit annas hummingbirds are found along the western coast of north america from southern canada to northern baja california and inland to southern and central arizona extreme southern nevada and southeastern utah and western texas 2  they tend to be permanent residents within their range and are very territorial however birds have been spotted far outside their range in such places as southern alaska saskatchewan new york florida louisiana and newfoundland 15  16 annas hummingbirds have the northernmost year round range of any hummingbird during cold temperatures annas hummingbirds gradually gain weight during the day as they convert sugar to fat 17  18  in addition hummingbirds with inadequate stores of body fat or insufficient plumage are able to survive periods of sub freezing weather by lowering their metabolic rate and entering a state of torpor 19 there are an estimated 15 million annas hummingbirds their population appears to be stable and they are not considered an endangered species 1 gallery edit a male showing his iridescent headreferences edit  a b birdlife international 2012 calypte anna iucn red list of threatened species version 20132

ruby throated hummingbird   wikipedia the ruby throated hummingbird archilochus colubris is a species of hummingbird that generally spends the winter in central america and migrates to eastern north america for the summer to breed it is by far the most common hummingbird seen east of the mississippi river in north americadescription edit juvenile male ruby throated hummingbird hoveringthis hummingbird is from 7 to 9 cm 28 to 35 in long and has an 8 to 11 cm 31 to 43 in wingspan weight can range from 2 to 6 g 0071 to 0212 oz with males averaging 34 g 012 oz against the slightly larger female which averages 38 g 013 oz 3  4  adults are metallic green above and greyish white below with near black wings their bill at up to 2 cm 079 in is long straight and very slender as in all hummingbirds the toes and feet of this species are quite small with a middle toe of around 06 cm 024 in and a tarsus of approximately 04 cm 016 in the ruby throated hummingbird can only shuffle if it wants to move along a branch though it can scratch its head and neck with its feet 5  6 the species is sexually dimorphic 7  the adult male has a gorget throat patch of iridescent ruby red bordered narrowly with velvety black on the upper margin and a forked black tail with a faint violet sheen the red iridescence is highly directional and appears dull black from many angles the female has a notched tail with outer feathers banded in green black and white and a white throat that may be plain or lightly marked with dusky streaks or stipples males are smaller than females and have slightly shorter bills juvenile males resemble adult females though usually with heavier throat markings 8  the plumage is molted once a year beginning in late summerhabitat range and migration edit female ruby throated hummingbird gadsden co floridamale ruby throated hummingbird on branchthe breeding habitat is throughout most of eastern north america and the canadian prairies in deciduous and pine forests and forest edges orchards and gardens the female builds a nest in a protected location in a shrub or a tree of all hummingbirds in the united states this species has the largest breeding range 5 the ruby throated hummingbird is migratory spending most of the winter in southern mexico and central america 9  as far south as extreme western panama 10  the west indies and southern florida during migration some birds embark on a nonstop 900 mile journey across the gulf of mexico and caribbean from panama to gulf coast 9  the bird breeds throughout the eastern united states east of the 100th meridian and in southern canada particularly ontario in eastern and mixed deciduous and broadleaved forest 11  12  in winter it is seen mostly in mexico and southern floridabehavior and metabolism edit ruby throated hummingbirds are solitary adults of this species are not social other than during courtship which lasts a few minutes the female also cares for her offspring both males and females of any age are aggressive toward other hummingbirds they may defend territories such as a feeding territory attacking and chasing other hummingbirds that enteras part of their spring migration portions of the population fly from the yucatan peninsula of mexico across the gulf of mexico arriving first in florida and louisiana 9  this feat is impressive as a 800 km 500 mi non stop flight over water would seemingly require a caloric energy that far exceeds an adult hummingbirds body weight of 3 g 011 oz 9  however researchers discovered the tiny birds can double their fat mass by approximately one gram in preparation for their gulf crossing then expend the entire calorie reserve from fat during the 20 hour non stop crossing when food and water are unavailable 9 hummingbirds have one of the highest metabolic rates of any animal with heart rates up to 1260 beats per minute breathing rate of about 250 breaths per minute even at rest and oxygen consumption of about 4 ml oxygenghour at rest 13  during flight hummingbird oxygen consumption per gram of muscle tissue is approximately 10 times higher than that seen for elite human athletes 9 they feed frequently while active during the day when temperatures drop particularly on cold nights they may conserve energy by entering hypothermic torpor 9 hummingbirds have many skeletal and flight muscle adaptations which allow great agility in flight muscles make up 25–30 of their body weight and they have long blade like wings that unlike the wings of other birds connect to the body only from the shoulder joint 14  this adaptation allows the wing to rotate almost 180° enabling the bird to fly not only forward but backward and to hover in mid air flight capabilities that are similar to insects and unique among birds 14  hummingbird hovering has been estimated to be 20 more efficient than performed by a helicopter drone 15 analysis of the main wing bone the humerus is thought to be specifically adapted for hovering flight hummingbirds have a relatively short humerus with proportionally massive deltoid pectoral muscles which permit pronounced wing supination during upstroke when hovering 16 a hummingbirds ability to hover is due to its small mass high wingbeat frequency and relatively large margin of mass specific power available for flight several anatomical features contribute further including proportionally massive major flight muscles pectoralis major and supracoracoideus and wing anatomy that enables the bird to leave its wings extended yet turned over supine during the upstroke this generates lift that supports body weight and maneuvering 17 hummingbirds achieve ability to support their weight and hover from wing beats creating lift on the downstroke of a wing flap and also on the upstroke in a ratio of 7525 respectively similarly to an insect 17  18  hummingbirds and insects gain lift during hovering partially through inversion of their cambered wings during an upstroke 18  during hovering hummingbird wings beat up to 80 times per second 15 nectar from flowers and flowering trees as well as small insects and spiders are its main food although hummingbirds are well known to feed on nectar small arthropods are an important source part of protein minerals and vitamins in the diet of adult hummingbirds hummingbirds show a slight preference for red orange and bright pink tubular flowers as nectar sources though flowers not adapted to hummingbird pollination eg willow catkins are also visited 10  their diet may also occasionally include sugar rich tree sap taken from sapsucker wells the birds feed from flowers using a long extendable tongue and catch insects on the wing or glean them from flowers leaves bark and spiders websyoung birds are fed insects for protein since nectar is an insufficient source of protein for the growing birds 10 reproduction edit as typical for their family ruby throated hummingbirds are thought to be polygynous polyandry and polygynandry may also occur they do not form breeding pairs with males departing immediately after the reproductive act and females providing all parental care 19 males arrive at the breeding area in the spring and establish a territory before the females arrive when the females return males court females that enter their territory by performing courtship displays they perform a dive display rising 245–31 m 80–102 ft above and 152–182 m 50–60 ft to each side of the female if the female perches the male begins flying in very rapid horizontal arcs less than 05 m 16 ft in front of her if the female is receptive to the male she may give a call and assume a solicitous posture with her tail feathers cocked and her wings drooped citation needed the nest is usually constructed on a small downward sloping tree limb 31 to 122 m 10 to 40 ft feet above the ground favored trees are usually deciduous such as oak hornbeam birch poplar or hackberry although pines have also been used nests have even been found on loops of chain wire and extension cords 5  the nest is composed of bud scales with lichen on the exterior bound with spiders silk and lined with fibers such as plant down often dandelion or thistle down and animal hair most nests are well camouflaged old nests may be occupied for several seasons but are repaired annually 10  as in all known hummingbird species the female alone constructs the nest and cares for the eggs and youngfemales lay two with a range of 1 to 3 white eggs about 129 mm × 85 mm 051 in × 033 in in size and produce one to two broods each summer 5  they brood the chicks over a period of 12 to 14 days by which point they are feathered and homeothermic the female feeds the chicks from 1 to 3 times every hour by regurgitation usually while the female continues hovering when they are 18 to 22 days old the young leave the nest and make their first flight 10 longevity and mortality edit female ruby throated hummingbird taking various defensive and evasive actions around a man made feederthe oldest known ruby throated hummingbird to be banded was 9 years and 1 month of age almost all hummingbirds of 7 years or more in age are females with males rarely surviving past 5 years of age reasons for higher mortality in males may include loss of weight during the breeding season due to the high energetic demands of defending a territory followed by energetically costly migration 9 a variety of animals prey on hummingbirds given the opportunity due to their small size hummingbirds are vulnerable even to passerine birds and other animals which generally feed on insects on the other hand only very swift predators can capture them and a free flying adult hummingbird is too nimble for most predators chief among their predators are the smaller swifter raptors like sharp shinned hawks merlins american kestrels and mississippi kites as well as domestic cats loggerhead shrikes and even greater roadrunners all of which are likely to ambush the hummingbird while it sits or sleeps on a perch or are distracted by breeding activities predatory lizards and bird eating snakes may also prey on the species especially on its tropical wintering grounds even large predacious invertebrates have preyed on ruby throated hummingbirds including praying mantises which have been seen to ambush adult hummingbirds at hummingbird feeders on more than one occasion orb weaver spiders and green darners blue jays are common predators of nests as are several other corvids in addition to some icterids bats squirrels and chipmunks 20  21  22  23 vocalization edit the vocalizations of ruby throated hummingbirds are rapid squeaky chirps which are used primarily for threats for example males may vocalize to warn another male that has entered his territoryduring the courtship displays the male makes a rapid tik tik tik tik tik tik sound apparently with his wings the sound is produced both during the shuttle display at each end of the side to side flight also the sound is made during dive displays a second rather faint repeated whining sound is sometimes produced with the outer tail feathers during the dive as the male flies over the female spreading and shutting the tail as he does soreferences edit  birdlife international 2012 archilochus colubris iucn red list of threatened species version 20132 international union for

long tailed jaeger   wikipedia the long tailed jaeger stercorarius longicaudus known as the long tailed skua outside the americas is a seabird in the skua family stercorariidaeetymology edit the word jaeger is derived from the german word jäger meaning hunter 2  the english word skua comes from the faroese name skúgvur  ˈskɪkvʊər  for the great skua with the island of skúvoy known for its colony of that bird the general faroese term for skuas is kjógvi  ˈtʃɛkvə  3  the genus name stercorarius is latin and means of dung the food disgorged by other birds when pursued by skuas was once thought to be excrement the specific longicaudus is from latin longus long and cauda tail 4 description edit long tailed jaeger in flightthis species is unmistakable as an adult with grey back dark primary wing feathers without a white flash black cap and very long tail adults often hover over their breeding territories juveniles are much more problematic and are difficult to separate from parasitic jaeger over the sea they are slimmer longer winged and more tern like than that species but show the same wide range of plumage variation however they are usually colder toned than arctic with greyer shades rather than brownthis is the smallest of the skua family at 38–58 cm 15–23 in depending on season and age however up to 29 cm 11 in of its length can be made up by the tail which may include the 15 cm 59 in tail streamers of the summer adult the wingspan of this species ranges from 102 to 117 cm 40 to 46 in and the body mass is 230–444 g 81–157 oz 5  6 subspecies edit two subspecies are described 7 breeding edit this species breeds in the high arctic of eurasia and north america with major populations in russia alaska and canada and smaller populations around the rest of the arctic it is a migrant wintering in the south atlantic and pacific passage juvenile birds sometimes hunt small prey in ploughed fields or golf courses and are typically quite fearless of humansthey nest on dry tundra or higher fells laying two spotted olive brown eggs on the breeding grounds they can be heard making yelping and rattling sounds outside of the breeding season they spend most of their time over open ocean and have a harsh kreeah cry this bird feeds on fish mainly caught from other seabirds smaller birds food scraps small mammals fruit and carrion on migration long tailed jaegers are more likely to catch their own food and less likely to steal from gulls and terns than larger speciesreferences edit external links edit 
pomarine skua   wikipedia the pomarine skua stercorarius pomarinus or pomatorhine skua 2  known as pomarine jaeger in the americas is a seabird in the skua family stercorariidae it is a migrant wintering at sea in the tropical oceanstaxonomy edit its relationships are not fully resolved its mitochondrial dna is most similar to the great skua 3  but from morphology and behavior it is closer to the lesser skuas such as the parasitic jaeger the most likely explanation is extensive hybridization between the great and one species of lesser skuas which resulted in a hybrid population that eventually evolved into a distinct species the pomarine skua or alternatively between the pomarine and a species of southern hemisphere skua with the great skua being the hybrid offspring perhaps appearing as recently as the 15th century 3  4  judging from characteristics of the skeleton and behavior the former seems more likely as the pomarine skua shares several similarities with the catharacta skuas while the great skua does not seem much different from its southern hemisphere relativesthe mtdna difference between the pomarine and the great skua is one of the smallest between any two vertebrate species yet analyzed being less than the variation found between different individuals of widespread species the apparent capability for hybridization has led to the abolition of the separate genus catharacta for the southern hemisphere and great skuasetymology edit the english word skua comes from the faroese name skúgvur  ˈskɪkvʊər  for the great skua with the island of skúvoy renowned for its colony of that bird the general faroese term for skuas is kjógvi  ˈtʃɛkvə  the word jaeger is derived from the german word jäger meaning hunter 5  6  the genus name stercorarius is latin and means of dung the food disgorged by other birds when pursued by skuas was once thought to be excrement the specific pomatorhinus is from ancient greek poma pomatos lid and rhis rhinos nostrils 7  this refers to the cere which the pomarine skua shares with the other skuas the name of this species is unrelated to the baltic sea region of pomerania 2 description edit this is a large skua at about 45cm length excluding the central tail feathers of the summer adult which can add another 10cm or sothis species ranges from 46 to 67 cm 18 to 26 in in length 110 to 138 cm 43 to 54 in in wingspan and 540–920 g 119–203 lb in weight 8  9  10  the upper limit of the length includes the elongated tail streamer of breeding adults which is about 10 cm 39 in in length identification of this skua is complicated by its similarities to parasitic jaeger and the existence of three morphs pomarine skuas are larger than common gulls they are much bulkier broader winged and less falcon like than the parasitic jaeger but show the same wide range of plumage variation the flight is more measured than that of the smaller species it has many harsh chattering calls and others which sounds like which yewlight morph adult pomarine skuas have a brown back mainly white underparts and dark primary wing feathers with a white flash the head and neck are yellowish white with a black cap dark morph adults are dark brown and intermediate morph birds are dark with somewhat paler underparts head and neck all morphs have the white wing flash which appears as a diagnostic double flash on the underwing in breeding adults of all morphs the two central tail feathers are much longer than the others spoon shaped and twisted from the horizontal juveniles are even more problematic to identify and are difficult to separate from parasitic jaegers at a distance on plumage alonebehaviour edit breeding edit this species breeds in the far north of eurasia and north america it nests on arctic tundra and islands laying 2–3 olive brown eggs in grass lined depressions like other skuas it will fly at the head of a human or other intruder approaching its nest although it cannot inflict serious damage the experience is frightening and painfulfeeding edit this bird feeds on fish carrion scraps smaller birds up to the size of common gull and rodents especially lemmings it robs gulls terns and even gannets of their catches like most other skua species it continues this piratical behaviour throughout the year showing great agility as it harasses its victims only the white tailed eagle and

blue jay   wikipedia the blue jay cyanocitta cristata is a passerine bird in the family corvidae native to north america it is resident through most of eastern and central united states although western populations may be migratory resident populations are also found in newfoundland canada while breeding populations can be found in southern canada it breeds in both deciduous and coniferous forests and is common near and in residential areas it is predominantly blue with a white chest and underparts and a blue crest it has a black u shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest sexes are similar in size and plumage and plumage does not vary throughout the year four subspecies of the blue jay are recognizedthe blue jay mainly feeds on nuts and seeds such as acorns soft fruits arthropods and occasionally small vertebrates it typically gleans food from trees shrubs and the ground though it sometimes hawks insects from the air like squirrels blue jays are known to hide nuts for later consumption 2  it builds an open cup nest in the branches of a tree which both sexes participate in constructing the clutch can contain two to seven eggs which are blueish or light brown with brown spots young are altricial and are brooded by the female for 8–12 days after hatching they may remain with their parents for one to two monthsthe birds name derives from its noisy garrulous nature 3  it is sometimes called a jaybird 4 taxonomy edit the blue jay was first described as pica glandaria cærulea cristata in english naturalist mark catesbys 1731 publication of natural history of carolina florida and the bahamas 5  it was later described as corvus cristatus in carl linnaeus 1758 edition of systema naturae 6  in the 19th century the jay was described by french ornithologist charles lucien bonaparte in 1838 as cyanocorax cristatus in a geographical and comparative list of the birds of europe and north america 7  and given its modern scientific name cyanocitta cristata by hugh edwin strickland in 1845 8 the genus name cyanocitta derives from the greek words kyaneos blue and the kitta and kissa chattering bird jay and the term blue chatterer refers to the bright blue plumage of the head nape back and tail of the bird the specific name cristata crested tufted derives from latin referring to the prominent blue crest of the jay 9 description edit the blue jay measures 22–30 cm 9–12 in from bill to tail and weighs 70–100 g 25–35 oz with a wingspan of 34–43 cm 13–17 in 10  11  jays from connecticut averaged 924 g 326 oz in mass while jays from southern florida averaged 737 g 260 oz 12  13  there is a pronounced crest on the head a crown of feathers which may be raised or lowered according to the birds mood when excited or aggressive the crest will be fully raised when frightened the crest bristles outwards brushlike when the bird is feeding among other jays or resting the crest is flattened on the head 14 its plumage is lavender blue to mid blue in the crest back wings and tail and its face is white the underside is off white and the neck is collared with black which extends to the sides of the head the wing primaries and tail are strongly barred with black sky blue and white the bill legs and eyes are all black males and females are almost identical but the male is slightly larger 11  15 as with most other blue hued birds the blue jays colouration is not derived from pigments but is the result of light interference due to the internal structure of the feathers 16  if a blue feather is crushed the blue disappears because the structure is destroyed 10  this is referred to as structural colourationdistribution and habitat edit the blue jay occurs from southern canada through the eastern and central united states south to florida and northeastern texas the western edge of the range stops where the arid pine forest and scrub habitat of the closely related stellers jay c stelleri begins recently the range of the blue jay has extended northwestwards so that it is now a rare but regularly seen winter visitor along the northern us and southern canadian pacific coast 10  as the two species ranges now overlap c cristata may sometimes hybridize with stellers jay 17  the increase in trees throughout the great plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated the western range expansion of the blue jay 18  19  as well as range expansions of many other species of birds 20  21  22 the northernmost subspecies c c bromia is migratory subject to necessity it may withdraw several hundred kilometres south in the northernmost parts of its range thousands of blue jays have been observed to migrate in flocks along the great lakes and atlantic coasts it migrates during the daytime in loose flocks of 5 to 250 birds much about their migratory behavior remains a mystery some are present throughout winter in all parts of their range young jays may be more likely to migrate than adults but many adults also migrate some individual jays migrate south one year stay north the next winter and then migrate south again the next year to date no one has concretely worked out why they migrate when they do likely it is related to weather conditions and how abundant the winter food sources are which can determine whether other northern birds will move south 23 the blue jay occupies a variety of habitats within its large range from the pine woods of florida to the spruce fir forests of northern ontario it is less abundant in denser forests preferring mixed woodlands with oaks and beeches 14  it has expertly adapted to human activity occurring in parks and residential areas and can adapt to wholesale deforestation with relative ease if human activity creates other means for the jays to get by 24 subspecies edit four subspecies are generally accepted though the variation within this species is rather subtle and essentially clinal no firm boundaries can be drawn between the inland subspecies the ranges of the coastal races are better delimited 15 cyanocitta cristata bromia – northern blue jaycanada and northern united states the largest subspecies with fairly dull plumage blue is rather palecyanocitta cristata cristata – coastal blue jaycoastal usa from north carolina to texas except southern florida mid sized and vivid bluecyanocitta cristata cyanotephra –

jaysouthern florida the smallest subspecies much like c c bromia in colourc c bromia northern blue jay juvenile in ontario canadac c bromia northern blue jay in ontario canadabehavior edit the blue jay is a noisy bold and aggressive passerine it is a moderately slow flier roughly 32–40 kmh 20–25 mph when unprovoked 25  it flies with body and tail held level with slow wing beats due to its slow flying speeds this species makes easy prey for hawks and owls when flying in open areas virtually all the raptorial birds sympatric in distribution with the blue jay may predate it especially swift bird hunting specialists such as the accipiter hawks diverse predators may predate jay eggs and young up to their fledging stage including tree squirrels snakes cats crows raccoons opossums other jays and possibly many of the same birds of prey who attack adults 26 the blue jay can be beneficial to other bird species as it may chase predatory birds such as hawks and owls and will scream if it sees a predator within its territory it has also been known to sound an alarm call when hawks or other dangers are near and smaller birds often recognize this call and hide themselves away accordingly it may occasionally impersonate the calls of raptors especially those of the red tailed and red shouldered hawks possibly to test if a hawk is in the vicinity though also possibly to scare off other birds that may compete for food sources 23  it may also be aggressive towards humans who come close to its nest and if an owl roosts near the nest during the daytime the blue jay mobs it until it takes a new roost however blue jays have also been known to attack or kill other smaller birds and sleeping foliage roosting bat species such as lasiurus borealis 27  jays are very territorial birds and they will chase others from a feeder for an easier meal additionally the blue jay may raid other birds nests stealing eggs chicks and nests however this may not be as common as is typically thought as only 1 of food matter in one study was bird material 23  despite this other passerines may still mob jays who come within their breeding territoriesblue jays like other corvids are highly curious and are considered intelligent birds young individuals playfully snatch brightly coloured or reflective objects such as bottle caps or pieces of aluminum foil and carry them around until they lose interest 27  while not confirmed to have engaged in tool use in the wild blue jays in captivity have been observed using strips of newspaper as tools to obtain food 23  28  while captive fledglings have been observed attempting to open the door to their cages 29 whole peanuts and other shelled food items are carried off in the beak to be dealt with at leisureblue jays have strong black bills which they use for cracking nuts usually while holding them with their feet and for eating corn grains and seeds its food is sought both on the ground and in trees and includes virtually all known types of plant and animal sources such as acorns and beech mast weed seeds grain fruits and other berries peanuts bread meat small invertebrates of many types scraps in town parks bird table food and rarely eggs and nestlings 23  blue jays will sometimes cache food though to what extent differs widely among individuals 30  although seemingly contentious in their general behavior blue jays are frequently subservient to other medium sized birds who visit bird feeders in florida blue jays were dominated at feeders by eastern gray squirrels florida scrub jays common grackles and red headed woodpeckers all of which were occasionally observed to aggressively prevent the jays from feeding 23 reproduction edit nest in the top of a little pinethe mating season begins in mid march peaks in mid april to may and extends into july any suitable tree or large bush may be used for nesting though an evergreen is preferred the nest is preferentially built at a height in the trees of 3 to 10 m 98 to 328 ft it is cup shaped and composed of twigs small roots bark strips moss other plant material cloth paper and feathers with occasional mud added to the cupblue jays are not very picky about nesting locations if no better place is available – eg in a heavily deforested area – they will even use places like the large mailboxes typical of the rural united states 24  they also appropriate nests of other mid sized songbirds as long as these are placed in suitable spots american robin nests are commonly used by blue jays for exampleblue jays typically form monogamous pair bonds for life both sexes build the nest and rear the young though only the female broods them the male feeds the female while she is brooding the eggs there are usually between 3 and 6 averaging 4 or 5 eggs laid and incubated over 16–18 days the young fledge usually between 17–21 days after hatching 27 after the juveniles fledge the family travels and forages together until early fall when the young birds disperse to avoid competition for food during the winter sexual maturity is reached after one year of age blue jays have been recorded to live for more than 26 years in captivity and one wild jay was found to have been around 17 and a half years old 31  a more common lifespan for wild birds that survive to adulthood is around 7 years citation needed  beyond predation and the occasional collision with man made objects a common cause of mortality in recent decades has been the west nile virus which corvids as a whole seem especially susceptible to however despite several major local declines overall blue jays have not seemed to have been depleted by the disease 26 vocalizations edit blue jays can make a large variety of sounds and individuals may vary perceptibly in their calling style like other corvids they may learn to mimic human speech blue jays can also copy the cries of local hawks so well that it is sometimes difficult to tell which it is 32  their voice is typical of most jays in being varied but the most commonly recognized sound is the alarm call which is a loud almost gull like scream there is also a high pitched jayer jayer call that increases in speed as the bird becomes more agitated this particular call can be easily confused with the chickadees song because of the slow starting chick ah dee ee blue jays will use these calls to band together to mob potential predators such as hawks and drive them away from the jays nestsblue jays also have quiet almost subliminal calls which they use among themselves in proximity one of the most distinctive calls of this type is often referred to as the rusty pump owing to its squeaky resemblance to the sound of an old hand operated water pump the blue jay and other corvids are distinct from most other songbirds for using their call as a songcultural depiction and interpretation edit in old african american folklore of the southern united states the blue jay was held to be a servant of the devil and was not encountered on a friday as he was fetching sticks down to hell furthermore he was so happy and chirpy on a saturday as he was relieved to return from hell 33 the blue jay was adopted as the team symbol of the toronto blue jays major league baseball team as well as some of their minor league affiliates their mascot is ace also a blue jaythe blue jay is featured in mark twains a tramp abroad

florida scrub jay   wikipedia the florida scrub jay aphelocoma coerulescens a  is one of the species of scrub jay native to north america it is the only species of bird endemic to the us state of florida and one of only 15 species endemic to the continental united states 3  because of this it is heavily sought by birders who travel from across the country to observe this unique species it is known to have been present in florida as a distinct species for at least 2 million years 4  and is possibly derived from the ancestors of woodhouses scrub jay 5 it measures 23 to 28 cm 91 to 110 in in length and weighs from 66 to 92 g 23 to 32 oz with an average 802 g 283 oz the wingspan of the jay is 33–36 cm 13–14 in 6  7  it has a strong black bill blue head and nape without a crest a whitish forehead and supercilium blue bib blue wings grayish underparts gray back long blue tail black legs and feetecology edit the florida scrub jay is found only in florida scrub habitat an ecosystem that exists only in central florida and is characterized by nutrient poor soil occasional drought and frequent wildfires because of its somewhat harsh weather pattern this habitat is host to a small assortment of very specific plants including sand pine sand live oak myrtle oak chapmans oak sandhill oak florida rosemary 8  and various other hardy plants such as eastern prickly pear 9 florida scrub jays are omnivorous and eat a wide variety of acorns seeds peanuts insects tree frogs turtles snakes lizards and young mice florida scrub jays have also been occasionally observed to eat other birds eggs or nestlings but this occurs rarely 10  they routinely cache thousands of acorns a year burying them just beneath the surface the acorns are typically buried in the fall and consumed during the winter and spring acorns that are forgotten or missed may germinate making the florida scrub jay an effective agent for the dispersal of a variety of oak treesscrub jays may also take silverware and other shiny objects in a manner similar to the american crowreproduction edit florida scrub jays are one of the few cooperative breeding birds in north america fledgling florida scrub jays remain in their parents habitat for several years and help to rear young watch for predators such as short tailed or accipiter hawks and defend territory against neighboring florida scrub jay family groups these families can range in size from 2 to 8juvenile florida scrub jayjuvenile florida scrub jay developing adult colorationafter about 2 to 3 years fledglings leave the group to form mating pairs of their own mating season ranges from march to june clutches usually contain about 3 to 4 eggs which are incubated in about 18 days fledging occurs in about 16 to 19 days fledglings can be distinguished from the adult birds due to the coloration of the feathers on their head which are brown instead of blue the brown feathers on the juveniles head are slowly replaced by blue feathers as the bird matures into adulthoodconservation edit scrub habitat has dwindled considerably in the past several decades as florida has continued to develop wildfire suppression also leads to the natural succession of large oaks and trees which changes the habitat in recent years environmental groups within the state have made a strong effort at preserving floridas remaining scrub through controlled burns and even clearing out areas of large trees to increase the size of a scrub habitat oscar scherer state park near sarasota has one of the larger habitats under state managementthe florida scrub jay was officially listed as a threatened state species by florida fish and wildlife conservation commission in 1975 and it was listed as a threatened federal species by the united states fish and wildlife service in 1987in 1993 there were estimated to be 4000 breeding pairs left in the wild despite the protections the scrub jay is still thought to be on the decline studies done in brevard county once the most numerous florida county for scrub jays noted declines of about 33 since the 1993 census aloneanother attempt to conserve the bird is an ongoing campaign to name the florida scrub jay the new state bird of florida the main argument for changing the state bird is that the current state bird viz the northern mockingbird is the state bird of several other states while the scrub jay is exclusive to floridain recent years there has been some debate about whether or not the florida scrub jay should be officially listed as an endangered species because of the loss of homes however environmentalists hope that current conservation efforts should help the species population to at least stabilizeon the other hand the iucn classifies this species as vulnerable to extinction 1  in 2004 the population was declining and no more than 10 subpopulations were known both the number of adult birds as well as amount and quality of habitat were in decline and local subpopulations were in danger of disappearing altogether about 8000 mature birds were believed to exist—with no more than 1000 in any one subpopulation—and population numbers had dropped by about 10 over the last decade or soa long term and ongoing study of the florida scrub jay has been taking place at the archbold biological station at lake placidthe florida scrub jay was featured in episode 11 season 3 of the showtime television series penn amp teller bullshitdangers of human feeding edit an inquisitive and intelligent species the most striking attribute of the florida scrub jays behavior is its remarkable tameness 11  as such scrub jays willingly take food from human handsunfortunately this tameness is dangerous to the well being of the species 12  florida scrub jays that are fed by humans will reproduce earlier in the year than those that are not however fledgling scrub jays feed primarily on caterpillars present in the late spring and summer if they hatch too early in the year when the caterpillars are not available this can lead to their malnutrition or starvationanother potential danger of feeding florida scrub jays occurs when people feed them near a road as one major cause

dark eyed junco   wikipedia the dark eyed junco junco hyemalis is a species of the juncos a genus of small grayish american sparrows this bird is common across much of temperate north america and in summer ranges far into the arctic it is a very variable species much like the related fox sparrow passerella iliaca and its systematics are still not completely untangleddescription edit adults generally have gray heads necks and breasts gray or brown backs and wings and a white belly but show a confusing amount of variation in plumage details the white outer tail feathers flash distinctively in flight and while hopping on the ground the bill is usually pale pinkish 2 males tend to have darker more conspicuous markings than the females the dark eyed junco is 13 to 175 cm 51 to 69 in long and has a wingspan of 18 to 25 cm 71 to 98 in 2  3  body mass can vary from 18 to 30 g 063 to 106 oz 2  among standard measurements the wing cord is 66 to 93 cm 26 to 37 in the tail is 61 to 73 cm 24 to 29 in the bill is 09 to 13 cm 035 to 051 in and the tarsus is 19 to 23 cm 075 to 091 in 4  juveniles often have pale streaks and may even be mistaken for vesper sparrows pooecetes gramineus until they acquire adult plumage at 2 to 3 months but junco fledglings heads are generally quite uniform in color already and initially their bills still have conspicuous yellowish edges to the gape remains of the fleshy wattles that guide the parents when they feed the nestlingsthe song is a trill similar to the chipping sparrows spizella passerina except that the red backed juncos see below song is more complex similar to that of the yellow eyed junco junco phaeonotus the call also resembles that of the black throated blue warblers which is a member of the new world warbler family 5  calls include tick sounds and very high pitched tinkling chips 6  it is known among bird language practitioners as an excellent bird to study for learning bird languagea sample of the song can be heard at the usgs web site here mp3 or at the cornell lab of ornithology web site heretaxonomy edit the dark eyed junco was described by linnaeus in his 1758 systema naturae as fringilla hyemalis the description consisted merely of the laconic remark f ringilla  nigra ventre albo a black finch with white belly a reference to a source and a statement that it came from america 7 linnaeus source was mark catesby who described the slate colored junco before binomial nomenclature as his snow bird moineau de neige or passer nivalis snow sparrow thusthe bill of this bird is white the breast and belly white all the rest of the body black but in some places dusky inclining to lead color in virginia and carolina they appear only in winter and in snow they appear most in summer none are seen whether they retire and breed in the north which is most probable or where they go when they leave these countries in spring is to me unknown  italics in original  8 the slate colored junco is unmistakable enough to make it readily recognizable even from linnaeus minimal descriptionjunco is the spanish for rush from latin juncus  9  its modern scientific name means winter junco from latin hyemalis of the winter 10 subspecies edit the several subspecies make up two large groups and three to five small or monotypic ones the five basic groups were formerly considered separate species and the guadalupe junco frequently still is but they interbreed extensively in areas of contact birders trying to identify subspecies are advised to consult detailed identification references 6  11 slate

underparts this makes it similar to the yellow eyed junco j phaeonotus except for the dark eye it is found in the southern mountains of arizona and new mexico 6  it does not overlap with the yellow eyed junco in breeding rangeguadalupe junco edit the extremely rare guadalupe junco is also considered part of this species by some authors namely the iucn which restores it to subspecies status in 2008 12  13  other authors consider it a species in its own right – perhaps a rather young one but certainly this population has evolved more rapidly than the mainland juncos due to its small population size and the founder effectecology edit their breeding habitat is coniferous or mixed forest areas throughout north america in otherwise optimal conditions they also utilize other habitat but at the southern margin of its range it can only persist in its favorite habitat 14  northern birds migrate further south arriving in their winter quarters between mid september and november and leaving to breed from mid march onwards with almost all gone by the end of april or so 14  15  many populations are permanent residents or altitudinal migrants while in cold years birds may choose to stay in the winter range and breed there 14  in winter juncos are familiar in and around towns and in many places are the most common birds at feeders 2  the slate colored junco is a rare vagrant to western europe and may successfully winter in great britain usually in domestic gardensthese birds forage on the ground in winter they often forage in flocks that may contain several subspecies they mainly eat insects and seedsthey usually nest in a cup shaped depression on the ground well hidden by vegetation or other material although nests are sometimes found in the lower branches of a shrub or tree the nests have an outer diameter of about 10 cm 39 in and are lined with fine grasses and hair normally two clutches of four eggs are laid during the breeding season the slightly glossy eggs are grayish or pale bluish white and heavily spotted sometimes splotched with various shades of brown purple or gray the spotting is concentrated at the large end of the egg the eggs are incubated by the female for 12 to 13 days young leave nest between 11 and 14 days after hatchingreferences edit  birdlife international 2012 junco hyemalis iucn red list of threatened species version 20132

belted kingfisher   wikipedia the belted kingfisher megaceryle alcyon is a large conspicuous water kingfisher the only member of that group commonly found in the northern united states and canada it is depicted on the 1986 series canadian 5 note all kingfishers were formerly placed in one family alcedinidae but recent research suggests that this should be divided into three subfamiliesdescription edit the belted kingfisher is a stocky medium sized bird that measures between 28–35 cm 11–14 in in length with a wingspan of between 48–58 cm 19–23 in this kingfisher can weigh from 113 to 178 g 40 to 63 oz 2  3  the adult female averages slightly larger than the adult malethis species has a large head with a shaggy crest its long heavy bill is black with a grey base these features are common in many kingfisher species this kingfisher shows sexual dimorphism with the female more brightly coloured than the male both sexes have a slate blue head large white collar a large blue band on the breast and white underparts the back and wings are slate blue with black feather tips with little white dots the female features a rufous band across the upper belly that extends down the flanks juveniles of this species are similar to adults but both sexes feature the rufous band on the upper belly juvenile males will have a rufous band that is somewhat mottled while the band on females will be much thinner than that on adult females 4 taxonomy and systematics edit megaceryle is from the ancient greek megas great and the existing genus ceryle the specific alcyon is latin for kingfisher 5 the megaceryle large green kingfishers were formerly placed in ceryle with the pied kingfisher but the latter is closer to the chloroceryle american green kingfishers the belted kingfishers closest living relative is the ringed kingfisher m torquata and these two in all probability originated from an african megaceryle which colonized the americas 6 distribution and habitat edit this birds breeding habitat is near inland bodies of waters or coasts across most of canada alaska and the united states they migrate from the northern parts of its range to the southern united states mexico central america and the west indies in winter it is a rare visitor to the northern areas of colombia venezuela and the guianas 7  8  9  during migration it may stray far from land the species is recorded as an accidental visitor on several pacific islands such as cocos island malpelo island hawaii the azores 10  clarion island 11  and has occurred as an extremely rare vagrant in ecuador 10  greenland ireland netherlands portugal and the united kingdom 1  the southernmost records of m alcyon are from the galapagos archipelago insular ecuador where it occurs as a migrant in small numbers but apparently not every year 12  13  14 it leaves northern parts of its range when the water freezes in warmer areas it is a permanent resident a few individuals may linger in the north even in the coldest winters except in the arctic if there are remaining open bodies of water 15 ecology and behaviour edit the belted kingfisher is often seen perched prominently on trees posts or other suitable watchpoints close to water before plunging in head first after its fish prey they also eat amphibians small crustaceans insects small mammals and reptilesthis bird nests in a horizontal tunnel made in a river bank or sand bank and excavated by both parents the female lays five to eight eggs and both adults incubate the eggs and feed the youngthe nest of the belted kingfisher is a long tunnel and often slopes uphill one possible reason for the uphill slope is that in case of flooding the chicks will be able to survive in the air pocket formed by the elevated end of the tunnel 16 references

pied kingfisher   wikipedia the pied kingfisher ceryle rudis is a water kingfisher and is found widely distributed across africa and asia its black and white plumage crest and the habit of hovering over clear lakes and rivers before diving for fish makes it distinctive males have a double band across the breast while females have a single gorget that is often broken in the middle they are usually found in pairs or small family parties when perched they often bob their head and flick up their taildescription edit this kingfisher is about 17 cm long and is white with a black mask a white supercilium and black breast bands the crest is neat and the upperparts are barred in black several subspecies are recognized within the broad distribution the nominate race is found in sub saharan africa extending into west asia a former subspecies syriaca is considered as merely a larger northern bird of the nominate species following bergmanns rule 2  subspecies leucomelanura is found from afghanistan east into india sri lanka thailand and laos the subspecies travancoreensis of the western ghats is darker with the white reduced subspecies c r insignis is found in hainan and southeastern china and has a much larger bill males have a narrow second breast band while females have a single broken breast band 3  4 distribution edit it is common throughout sub saharan africa and southern asia from turkey to india to china it is resident and most birds do not migrate other than short distance seasonal movements 5  in india it is distributed mainly on the plains and is replaced in the higher hills of the himalayas by megaceryle lugubris 6 the pied kingfisher is estimated to be the worlds third most common kingfisher and being a noisy bird hard to miss 5 behaviour and ecology edit pied kingfishers fishing manoeuvre combined in a single imagepied kingfisher in flightthis kingfisher feeds mainly on fish although it will take crustaceans and large aquatic insects such as dragonfly larvae 7  it usually hunts by hovering over the water to detect prey and diving vertically down bill first to capture fish when not foraging they have a straight rapid flight and have been observed flying at nearly 50 kmh 8  in lake victoria in east africa the introduction of the nile perch reduced the availability of haplochromine cichlids which were formerly the preferred prey of these birds 9 they can deal with prey without returning to a perch often swallowing small prey in flight and so can hunt over large water bodies or in estuaries that lack perches that are required by other kingfishers unlike some kingfishers it is quite gregarious and forms large roosts at night 10  11  when perched the often bob their heads up and down and will sometimes raise their tail and flick it downwards they call often with sharp chirruk chirruk notes 12 the breeding season is february to april its nest is a hole excavated in a vertical mud bank about five feet above water the nest tunnel is 4 to 5 feet deep and ends in a chamber several birds may nest in the same vicinity the usual clutch is 3–6 white eggs 13  the pied kingfisher sometimes reproduces cooperatively with young non breeding birds from an earlier brood assisting parents or even unrelated older birds 14  in india nestings have been found to be prone to maggot infestations probably by protocalliphora sp 15  and in some areas to leeches 16  nest holes may sometimes be used for roosting 12 this species was initially believed to be descended from an ancestral american green kingfisher which crossed the atlantic ocean about 1 million years ago 17  a more recent suggestion is that the pied kingfisher and the american green kingfishers are derived from an old world species with the pied kingfisher or its ancestor losing the metallic colouration afterwards 18 in 1947 h b cott noticed while skinning birds that hornets were attracted to certain birds but avoided the flesh of pied kingfishers this led to a comparative study of edibility of birds and he suggested that more conspicuously plumaged birds may be less palatable this suggestion was however not supported by a subsequent reanalysis of his data

white throated kingfisher   wikipedia the white throated kingfisher halcyon smyrnensis also known as the white breasted kingfisher or smyrna kingfisher is a tree kingfisher 2  widely distributed in asia from turkey east through the indian subcontinent to the philippines this kingfisher is a resident over much of its range although some populations may make short distance movements it can often be found well away from water where it feeds on a wide range of prey that includes small reptiles amphibians crabs small rodents and even birds during the breeding season they call loudly in the mornings from prominent perches including the tops of buildings in urban areas or on wiresdescription edit this is a large kingfisher 28 cm in length the adult has a bright blue back wings and tail its head shoulders flanks and lower belly are chestnut and the throat and breast are white the large bill and legs are bright red the flight of the white throated kingfisher is rapid and direct the short rounded wings whirring in flight large white patches are visible on the blue and black wings sexes are similar but juveniles are a duller version of the adultthis species forms a superspecies with halcyon cyanoventris and most major works recognize four geographic races they vary clinally in size the shades of blue on the mantle which is more greenish in smyrnensis and fusca and more blue

are not threatened average density of 458 individuals per km2 has been noted in the sundarbans mangroves 8 behaviour and ecology edit feeding and diet edit white throated kingfishers forage mainly on land here a h s fusca from india holds a skinkit perches conspicuously on wires or other exposed perches within its territory and is a frequent sight in south asia this species mainly hunts large crustaceans 9  insects earthworms 10  rodents snakes fish and frogs 11  12  predation of small birds such as the oriental white eye chick of a red wattled lapwing sparrows and munias have been reported 13  14  15  the young are fed mostly on invertebrates 16  in captivity it has been noted that it rarely drinks water although bathing regularly 17 breeding edit the white throated kingfisher begins breeding at the onset of the monsoons males perch on prominent high posts in their territory and call in the early morning the tail may be flicked now and in its courtship display the wings are stiffly flicked open for a second or two exposing the white wing mirrors they also raise their bill high and display the white throat and front the female in invitation makes a rapid and prolonged kit kit kit call the nest is a tunnel 50 cm long but a nest with a 3 foot tunnel has been noted 18  in an earth bank the nest building begins with both birds flying into a suitable mud wall until an indentation is made where they can find a perch hold they subsequently perch and continue digging the nest with their bills nest tunnels in a haystack have also been recorded 19  a single clutch of 4 7 round white eggs is typical the eggs take 20–22 days to hatch while the chicks fledge in 19 days 13  20  21 movements edit birds have sometimes been seen attracted to lights at night especially during the monsoon season suggesting that they are partly migratory 13 mortality edit white throated kingfisherwith a powerful bill and rapid flight these kingfishers have few predators when healthy and rare cases of predation by a black kite 22  and a jungle crow may be of sick or injured birds 23  an individual found dead with its beak embedded into the wood of a tree has been suggested as an accident during rapid pursuit of prey possibly an oriental white eye 15  a few parasites have been noted 24 in the 1800s these birds were hunted for their bright feathers that were used to adorn hats

mallard   wikipedia wild duck redirects here for the play by henrik ibsen see the wild duckthe mallard  or ˈmælərd or wild duck anas platyrhynchos is a dabbling duck which breeds throughout the temperate and subtropical americas europe asia and north africa and has been introduced to new zealand australia peru brazil uruguay argentina chile the falkland islands and south africa 2  this duck belongs to the subfamily anatinae of the waterfowl family anatidaemale mallard sweden 2016the male birds drakes have a glossy green head and are grey on wings and belly while the females hens or ducks have mainly brown speckled plumage both sexes have an area of white bordered black speculum feathers which commonly also include iridescent blue feathers especially among males mallards live in wetlands eat water plants and small animals and are social animals preferring to congregate in groups or flocks of varying sizes this species is the main ancestor of most breeds of domesticated ducks 3 taxonomy and evolution edit the mallard was one of the many bird species originally described by carl linnaeus in his 18th century work systema naturae and still bears its original binomial name 4  the scientific name is from latin anas duck and ancient greek platyrhynchus  broad billed  from platus broad and rhunkhos  bill 5 mallard originally referred to any wild drake and it is sometimes still used this way 6  it was derived from the old french malart or mallart for wild drake although its true derivation is unclear it may be related to or at least influenced by an old high german masculine proper name madelhart clues lying in the alternate english forms maudelard or mawdelard 7  masle male has also been proposed as an influence 8 mallards frequently interbreed with their closest relatives in the genus anas such as the american black duck and also with species more distantly related such as the northern pintail leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile 9  this is quite unusual among such different species and apparently is because the mallard evolved very rapidly and recently during the late pleistocene the distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non overlapping ranges and behavioural cues but are still not fully genetically incompatible 10  mallards and their domesticated conspecifics are also fully interfertilethe genome of anas platyrhynchos was sequenced in 2013 11 mallards appear to be closer to their indo pacific relatives than to their american ones judging from biogeography considering mitochondrial dna d loop sequence data they may have evolved in the general area of siberia mallard bones rather abruptly appear in food remains of ancient humans and other deposits of fossil bones in europe without a good candidate for a local predecessor species 12  the large ice age palaeosubspecies which made up at least the european and west asian populations during the pleistocene has been named anas platyrhynchos palaeoboschas citation needed in their mitochondrial dna mallards are differentiated between north america and eurasia 13  however in the nuclear genome there is a particular lack of genetic structure 14  haplotypes typical of american mallard relatives and spotbills can be found in mallards around the bering sea 15  the aleutian islands hold a population of mallards that appear to be evolving towards a subspecies as gene flow with other populations is very limited 12 the size of the mallard varies clinally and birds from greenland although larger than birds further south have smaller bills and are stockier they are sometimes separated as subspecies the greenland mallard a p conboschas citation needed mallard duck in approach for landingdescription edit iridescent feathers of the male headthe mallard is a medium sized waterfowl species although it is often slightly heavier than most other dabbling ducks it is 50–65 cm 20–26 in long of which the body makes up around two thirds has a wingspan of 81–98 cm 32–39 in 16  and weighs 072–158 kg 16–35 lb 17  18  among standard measurements the wing chord is 257 to 306 cm 101 to 120 in the bill is 44 to 61 cm 17 to 24 in and the tarsus is 41 to 48 cm 16 to 19 in 19 the breeding male mallard is unmistakable with a glossy bottle green head and white collar which demarcates the head from the purple tinged brown breast grey brown wings and a pale grey belly the rear of the male is black with the dark tail having white borders 20  the bill of the male is a yellowish orange tipped with black while that of the female is generally darker ranging from black to mottled orange the female mallard is predominantly mottled with each individual feather showing sharp contrast from buff to very dark brown a coloration shared by most female dabbling ducks and has buff cheeks eyebrow throat and neck with a darker crown and eye stripe 20 owing to their highly malleable genetic code mallards can display a large amount of variation as seen here with this female who displays faded or apricot plumageboth male and female mallards have distinct iridescent purple blue speculum feathers edged with white prominent in flight or at rest though temporarily shed during the annual summer moult upon hatching the plumage colouring of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face with streaks by the eyes and black on the back with some yellow spots all the way to the top and back of the head its legs and bill are also black as it nears a month in age the ducklings plumage will start becoming drab looking more like the female though its plumage is more streaked and its legs will lose their dark grey colouring 20  two months after hatching the fledgling period has ended and the duckling is now a juvenile between three and four months of age the juvenile can finally begin flying as its wings are fully developed for flight which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers its bill will soon lose its dark grey colouring and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors the bill colouring is yellow in males black and orange for females the breast feathers are reddish brown for males brown for females the centre tail feather is curled for males called a drake feather straight for females citation needed during the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood 6–10 months of age the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles slowly changes to its characteristic colours citation needed  this plumage change also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period the adulthood age for mallards is 14 months and the average life expectancy is 3 years but they can live to twenty 21 an american black duck top left and a male mallard bottom right in eclipse plumageseveral species of duck have brown plumaged females which can be confused with the female mallard the female gadwall a strepera has an orange lined bill white belly black and white speculum which is seen as a white square on the wings in flight and is a smaller bird 20  more similar to the female mallard in north america are the american black duck a rubripes which is notably darker hued in both sexes than the mallard and the mottled duck a fulvigula which is somewhat darker than the female mallard with no white edge on the speculum and slightly different bare part colourationin captivity domestic ducks come in wild type plumages white and other colours most of these colour variants are also known in domestic mallards not bred as livestock but kept as pets aviary birds etc where they are rare but increasing in availabilitya noisy species the female has a deeper quack stereotypically associated with ducks 22  23  male mallards also make a sound which is phonetically similar to that of the female but it is a deep and raspy sound which can also sound like mek or whak when incubating a nest or when offspring are present females vocalise differently making a call which sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack they will also hiss if the nest or their offspring are threatened or interfered withthe mallard is a rare example of both allens rule and bergmanns rule in birds bergmanns rule which states that polar forms tend to be larger than related ones from warmer climates has numerous examples in birds allens rule says that appendages like ears tend to be smaller in polar forms to minimize heat loss and larger in tropical and desert equivalents to facilitate heat diffusion and that the polar taxa are stockier overall examples of this rule in birds are rare as they lack external ears however the bill of ducks is very well supplied with blood vessels and is vulnerable to cold citation needed due to the malleability of the mallards genetic code which gives it its vast interbreeding capability mutations in the genes that decide plumage colour are very common and have resulted in a wide variety of hybrids such as brewers duck mallard × gadwall anas strepera 24 distribution and habitat edit the mallard is widely distributed across the northern and southern hemispheres in north america from southern and central alaska to mexico the hawaiian islands across eurasia from iceland and southern greenland and parts of morocco north africa in the west scandinavia to the north and to siberia japan and south korea in the east australia and new zealand in the southern hemisphere 16  it is strongly migratory in the northern parts of its breeding range and winters farther south for example in north america it winters south to mexico but also regularly strays into central america and the caribbean between september and may 25 the mallard inhabits a wide range of habitat and climates from arctic tundra to subtropical regions it is found in both fresh  and salt water wetlands including parks small ponds rivers lakes and estuaries as well as shallow inlets and open sea within sight of the coastline water depths of less than 1 metre 33 ft are preferred birds avoiding areas more than a few metres deep they are attracted to bodies of water with aquatic vegetation 23 male mallard duck in lecco lake in italyanas platyrhynchos swimming familiesbehaviour edit feeding edit the mallard is omnivorous and very flexible in its foods choice its diet may vary based on several factors including the stage of the breeding cycle short term variations in available food nutrient availability and inter and intraspecific competition 26  the majority of the mallards diet seems to be made up of gastropods invertebrates including beetles flies lepidopterans dragonflies and caddisflies crustaceans worms many varieties of seeds and plant matter and roots and tubers during the breeding season male birds were recorded to have eaten 376 animal matter and 624 plant matter most notably echinochloa crus galli and nonlaying females ate 370 animal matter and 630 plant matter while laying females ate 719 animal matter and only 281 plant matter 27  plants generally make up a larger part of the birds diet especially during autumn migration and in the winter 28  29 it usually feeds by dabbling for plant food or grazing there are reports of it eating frogs it usually nests on a river bank but not always near water it is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and forms large flocks which are known as sords 30 breeding edit mallards usually form pairs in october and november in the northern hemisphere only until the female lays eggs at the start of nesting season which is around the beginning of spring at which time she is left by the male who joins up with other males to await the moulting period which begins in june in the northern hemisphere during the brief time before this however the males are still sexually potent and some of them either remain on standby to sire replacement clutches for female mallards that have lost or abandoned their previous clutch or forcibly mate with females that appear to be isolated or unattached regardless of their species and whether or not they have a brood of ducklingsduckling one to two days oldfemale swimming with ducklings less than a week oldthe nesting period can be very stressful for the female since she lays more than half her body weight in eggs she requires a lot of rest and a feedingloafing area that is safe from predators when seeking out a suitable nesting site the females preferences are areas that are well concealed inaccessible to ground predators or have few predators nearby this can include nesting sites in urban areas such as roof gardens enclosed courtyards and flower boxes on window ledges and balconies more than one story up which the ducklings cannot leave safely without human intervention the clutch is 8–13 eggs which are incubated for 27–28 days to hatching with 50–60 days to fledgling the ducklings are precocial and fully capable of swimming as soon as they hatch however filial imprinting compels them to instinctively stay near the mother not only for warmth and protection but also to learn about and remember their habitat as well as how and where to forage for food when ducklings mature into flight capable juveniles they learn about and remember their traditional migratory routes unless they are born and raised in captivity after this the juveniles and the mother may either part or remain together until the breeding season arrives citation needed during the breeding season both male and female mallards can become aggressive driving off competitors to themselves or their mate by charging at them males tend to fight more than females and attack each other by repeatedly pecking at their rivals chest ripping out feathers and even skin on rare occasionswhen they pair off with mating partners often one or several drakes end up left out this group sometimes targets an isolated female duck even one of a different species and proceeds to chase and peck at her until she weakens at which point the males take turns copulating with the female lebret 1961 calls this behaviour attempted rape flight and cramp amp simmons 1977 speak of rape intent flights male mallards also occasionally chase other male ducks of a different species and even each other in the same way in one documented case of homosexual necrophilia a male mallard copulated with another male he was chasing after the chased male died upon flying into a glass window 31  this paper was awarded with an ig nobel prize in 2003 32 mallards are opportunistically targeted by brood parasites occasionally having eggs laid in their nests by redheads ruddy ducks lesser scaup gadwalls northern shovelers northern pintails cinnamon teal common goldeneyes and other mallards these eggs are generally accepted when they resemble the eggs of the host mallard although the hen may attempt to eject them or even abandon the nest if parasitism occurs during egg laying 33  mallards of all ages but especially young ones and in all locations must contend with a wide diversity of predators including raptors mustelids corvids snakes raccoons opossums skunks turtles large fish and felids and canids including domesticated ones 34  the most prolific natural predators of adult mallards are red foxes which most often pick off brooding females and the faster or larger birds of prey ie peregrine falcons aquila eagles or haliaeetus eagles 35  36  in north america adult mallards face no fewer than 15 species of birds of prey from hen harriers and short eared owls both smaller than a mallard to huge bald and golden eagles and about a dozen species of mammalian predator not counting several more avian and mammalian predators who threaten eggs and nestlings 33 mallards are also preyed upon by other waterside apex predators such as the grey heron ardea cinerea european herring gull larus argentatus and the northern pike esox lucius crows corvus sp are also known to kill ducklings and adults on occasionconservation edit by carl friedrich deiker 1875several drakes swim in a pondunlike many waterfowl mallards have benefited from human alterations to the world   so much so that they are now considered an invasive species in some regionsthey are a common sight in urban parks lakes ponds and other manmade water features in the regions they inhabit and are often tolerated or encouraged among human habitat due to their placid nature towards humans and their beautiful and iridescent colors while most are not domesticated mallards are so successful at coexisting in human regions that the main conservation risk they pose comes from the loss of genetic diversity among a regions traditional ducks once humans and mallards colonize an area mallards are very adaptable being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localized sensitive species of waterfowl before development the release of feral mallards in areas where they are not native sometimes creates problems through interbreeding with indigenous waterfowl these non migratory mallards interbreed with indigenous wild ducks from local populations of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring complete hybridization of various species of wild ducks gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous waterfowl the wild mallard itself is the ancestor of most domestic ducks and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted in turn by the domesticated and feral populations 37  38  39 over time a continuum of hybrids ranging between almost typical examples of either species will develop the speciation process beginning to reverse itself 40  this has created conservation concerns for relatives of the mallard such as the hawaiian duck 41  42  the a s superciliosa subspecies of the pacific black duck 41  43  44  45  the american black duck 41  46  47  48  the mottled duck 41  49  50  51  mellers duck 52  the yellow billed duck 40  and the mexican duck 41  51  in the latter case even leading to a dispute whether these birds should be considered a species 53  and thus entitled to more conservation research and funding or included in the mallard in the cases mentioned below and above however ecological changes and hunting have led to a decline of local species for example the new zealand grey duck population declined drastically due to overhunting in the mid 20th century 45  hybrid offspring of hawaiian ducks seem to be less well adapted to native habitat and utilizing them in reintroduction projects apparently reduces success 41  54  in summary the problems of mallards hybridizing away relatives is more a consequence of local ducks declining than of mallards spreading allopatric speciation and isolating behaviour have produced todays diversity of mallard like ducks despite the fact that in most if not all of these populations hybridization must have occurred to some extent citation needed regions considered invasive edit the mallard is considered an invasive species in new zealand 16  where it competes with the local new zealand grey duck which was overhunted in the past there and elsewhere mallards are spreading with increasing urbanisation and hybridizing with local relatives 41 mallards are also causing severe genetic pollution of south africas biodiversity by breeding with endemic ducks although the agreement on the conservation of african eurasian migratory waterbirds applies to the mallard the hybrids of mallards and the yellow billed duck are fertile and can produce more hybrid offspring if this continues only hybrids will occur and in the long term this will result in the extinction of various indigenous waterfowl the mallard duck can cross breed with 63 other species citation needed  and is posing a severe threat to the genetic integrity of indigenous waterfowl mallards and their hybrids compete with indigenous birds for resources such as food nest sites and roosting sites 39 the availability of mallards mallard ducklings and fertilized mallard eggs for public sale and private ownership either as livestock or as pets is currently legal in the united states except for the state of florida which has currently banned domestic ownership of mallards this is to prevent hybridisation with the native mottled duck 55 the eastern or chinese spot billed duck is currently introgressing into the mallard populations of the primorsky krai possibly due to habitat changes from global warming 15  the mariana mallard was a resident allopatric population—in most respects a good species—apparently initially derived from mallard pacific black duck hybrids 56  unfortunately it became extinct in the late twentieth century 57 the laysan duck is an insular relative of the mallard with a very small and fluctuating population mallards sometimes arrive on its island home during migration and can be expected to occasionally have remained and hybridized with laysan ducks as long as these species have existed but these hybrids are less well adapted to the peculiar ecological conditions of laysan island than the local ducks and thus have lower fitness and furthermore there were—apart from a brief time in the early 20th century when the laysan duck was almost extinct—always many more laysan ducks than stray mallards thus in this case the hybrid lineages would rapidly fail citation needed relationship with humans edit as noted mallards have had a long and nearly symbiotic relationship with humans humans create an urban adaptation of traditional waterways to which mallards are better suited than native ducks giving them an evolutionary advantage and have frequently domesticated mallards both as pets and a food species citation needed  mallards have often been ubiquitous in their regions among the ponds rivers and streams of human parks farms and other man made waterways   even to the point of visiting water features in human courtyardsthe mallard is depicted in a marginal decoration of the 15th century english illuminated manuscript the sherborne missal 58  since 1933 the peabody hotel in downtown memphis tennessee has maintained a long tradition of keeping one mallard drake and four mallard hens called the peabody ducks as a popular hotel attraction and as guests of honour the mallards are provided by a local farmer and friend of the peabody hotel and are rotated out and returned to the farm for a new team of mallards every three months this tradition has also been maintained and observed at the other peabody hotels in little rock arkansas and orlando florida 59  the childrens picture book make way for ducklings published in 1941 and winner of the 1942 caldecott medal for its illustrations is the story of a pair of mallards who decide to raise their family on an island in the lagoon in boston public garden in massachusetts duck head a us clothing brand uses the image of a mallards head as its logo 60 although mallard do not have as fine a flavour as teal citation needed  they have the advantage of being one of the larger ducks so are commonly bred for waterfowl hunting and domestic consumption 61  shot sizes four and five are recommended for a clean and efficient kill in shooting mallard 62 references edit  birdlife international 2012 anas platyrhynchos iucn red list of threatened species version 20132 international union for conservation of nature

hooded merganser   wikipedia this article is about lophodytes an aquatic bird for the genus of true bugs see lopodytesthe hooded merganser lophodytes cucullatus is a species of small duck it is the only extant species in the genus lophodytes the bird is striking in appearance both sexes have crests that they can raise or lower and the breeding plumage of the male is handsomely patterned and coloured the hooded merganser has a sawbill but is not classified as a typical merganserhooded mergansers are the second smallest species of merganser with only the smew of europe and asia being smaller and it also is the only merganser whose native habitat is restricted to north americaa species of fossil duck from the late pleistocene of vero beach florida was described as querquedula floridana a genus now included in anas but upon reexamination turned out to be a species closely related to the hooded merganser it is now named lophodytes floridanus but the exact relationship between this bird and the modern species is unknowndescription edit the hooded merganser is a sexually dimorphic species the adult female has a greyish brown body with a narrow white patch over the lower breast and belly she has a light reddish brown crest extending from the back of the head during the nonbreeding season the male looks similar to the female except that his eyes are yellow and the females eyes are brownin breeding plumage the dorsal areas and the head neck and breast of the mature male are mainly black with white markings there are large white patches on either side of the crest and they are particularly conspicuous when he raises his crest during courtship his lower flanks are a rich reddish brown or chestnut in colour and the breast and undersides are more or less white extending into white stripes across the crop and breastin both genders there are narrower pencilled white stripes along the tertial wing feathers when the bird is in repose then if the tertial feather stripes are visible they have the appearance of longitudinal white stripes along the birds lower back 2 first winter birds differ from adult females in appearance in that they have a grey brown neck and upper parts the upper parts of adult females are much darker — nearly black furthermore the young birds have narrower white edges to their tertial feathers than adults do females of all ages are dark eyed whereas in males the eyes become pale during their first winter 3 habitat edit for preference the hooded merganser lives on small bodies of water such as ponds and small estuaries where there is ample emergent aquatic vegetation but it also inhabits larger wetlands impoundments flooded timber and rivers they prefer fresh water but do occur on brackish water bodies as well 4 the hooded merganser is a diving predator that largely hunts by sight while under water most studies report that its diet varies according to circumstances usually being dominated by fishes 44 81 in addition it feeds on aquatic insects 13 20 of its diet and other aquatic invertebrates such as crabs and crayfish 22 50 5 reproduction edit males and females of the hooded merganser form monogamous pairs and they remain together until the female has selected a nesting cavity and completed laying her clutch after that the male leaves the female to incubate and care for the brood females will actively seek out cavities in dead trees or artificial nest boxes such as those provided for nesting wood ducks they prefer cavities 4–15 feet off the ground breeding occurs anytime between the end of february and the end of june depending on the regionthe female will lay a clutch of 7 15 eggs but only begins incubation when the last egg has been laid thereby permitting synchronous hatching all hatchlings are consequently of the same size which facilitates efficient parental care during incubation the female may lose anywhere from 8 to 16 of her body weightlike most waterfowl hooded merganser hatchlings are precocial and usually leave the nest within 24 hours after they hatch this is about long enough to accommodate synchronous hatching once they leave the nest the young are capable of diving and foraging but remain with the female for warmth and protection 6 distribution edit hooded mergansers are short distance migrants and they winter in the united states in regions where winter temperatures allow for ice free conditions on ponds lakes and rivers they have two major year round ranges one is in the eastern united states from the southern canada–us border along the atlantic coast to the gulf coast in the region of the mississippi delta a smaller year round range extends from washington state and southern british columbia to northern idahothey also breed to some extent in regions from missouri to southern canada and from nova scotia to eastern north dakota and saskatchewan migrating when necessary to avoid winter conditions 7 vagrancy to europe edit although the hooded merganser is a common species in captivity in europe and most specimens recorded in the wild are regarded as escapes a small number of birds have been regarded as genuinely wild vagrants britains current first accepted record is a bird which was seen on north uist in october 2000 8  small numbers are seen regularly in dublin but these are presumed to be escapesmanagement and conservation edit population declines in the past have been linked with large scale deforestation because these waterfowl are cavity nesters they require mature trees in which suitable nesting sites are likely to be found it has been suggested that in recent years proper timber management is increasing available habitat successfully one priority consideration when managing wooded habitat for cavity nesting ducks is to maintain a sufficient population of mature trees in which suitable nesting cavities would be plentiful 9  in addition these ducks do make use of artificial nest boxes when available and such accommodation should be provided wherever suitable natural habitat is lacking 10 because of their high reliance on aquatic prey hooded mergansers are very susceptible to harm from many types of pollution some of which are poisons that accumulate in the food organisms directly poisoning predators high in the food chain and some of which simply reduce the populations of their prey 9 see also edit references edit external links edit

mockingbird   wikipedia mockingbirds are a group of new world passerine birds from the mimidae family they are best known for the habit of some species mimicking the songs of other birds and the sounds of insects and amphibians 1  often loudly and in rapid succession there are about 17 species in three genera these do not appear to form a monophyletic lineage mimus and nesomimus are quite closely related their closest living relatives appear to be some thrashers such as the sage thrasher melanotis is more distinct it seems to represent a very ancient basal lineage of mimidae 2  3 some types of mockingbirds are known to lay alien eggs or eggs that are laid in another birds nest similar to the cowbird the mockingbirds offspring will force the other nest inhabitants from the nest taking all the food from the parents and forcing the foster parents to rear and fledge themthe only mockingbird commonly found in north america is the northern mockingbird mimus polyglottos the greek word polyglottos means multiple languagesspecies in taxonomic order edit mimusbrown backed mockingbird mimus dorsalisbahama mockingbird mimus gundlachiilong tailed mockingbird mimus longicaudatuspatagonian mockingbird mimus patagonicuschilean mockingbird mimus thencawhite banded mockingbird mimus triurusnorthern mockingbird mimus polyglottossocorro mockingbird mimus graysonitropical mockingbird mimus gilvuschalk browed mockingbird mimus saturninusformerly nesomimus endemic to the galapagosmelanotisdarwin and mockingbirds edit when the survey voyage of hms beagle visited the galápagos islands in september to october 1835 the naturalist charles darwin noticed that the mockingbirds mimus thenca differed from island to island and were closely allied in appearance to mockingbirds on the south american mainland nearly a year later when writing up his notes on the return voyage he speculated that this together with what he had been told about galápagos tortoises could undermine the doctrine of stability of species this was his first recorded expression of his doubts about species being immutable which led to his being convinced about the transmutation of species and hence evolutionexternal links edit 
nighthawk   wikipedia a nighthawk is a nocturnal bird of the subfamily chordeilinae within the nightjar family caprimulgidae the term nighthawk first recorded in the king james version of 1611 was originally a local name in england for the european nightjar its use in the americas refers to members of the genus chordeiles and related genera was first recorded in 1778 1 nighthawks are medium sized birds with long wings short legs and very short bills they usually nest on the ground they feed on flying insects the least nighthawk at 16 centimetres 63 in and 23 grams 081 oz is the smallest of all caprimulgiformes nightjars are sometimes referred to as goatsuckers from the mistaken belief that they suck milk from goats the latin for goatsucker is caprimulgusnighthawks have small feet of little use for walking and long pointed wings their soft plumage is cryptically coloured to resemble bark or leaves some species perch facing along a branch rather than across it as birds usually do this helps to conceal them during the day the female lays two patterned eggs directly onto bare groundthey are mostly active in the late evening and early morning or at night and feed on moths and other large flying insects the bill opens very wide and has a slightly hooked upper tipnighthawks are similar in most respects to the nightjars but have shorter bills and plumage that is less soft nighthawks are less strictly nocturnal than many nightjars and may be seen hunting when there is still light in the skyspecies edit references edit 
clarks nutcracker   wikipedia clarks nutcracker nucifraga columbiana sometimes referred to as clarks crow or woodpecker crow is a passerine bird in the family corvidae it is slightly smaller than its eurasian relative the spotted nutcracker n caryocatactes it is ashy grey all over except for the black and white wings and central tail feathers the outer ones are white the bill legs and feet are also black this bird derives its name from the explorer william clarkit can be seen in western north america from british columbia and western alberta in the north to baja california and central new mexico in the south there is also a small isolated population on the peak of cerro potosí elevation 3700 metres 12200 ft in nuevo león northeast mexico it is mainly found in mountains at altitudes of 900–3900 metres 3000–12900 ft in conifer forest outside the breeding season it may wander extensively to lower altitudes and also further east as far as illinois and exceptionally pennsylvania particularly following any cone crop failure in its normal areasthe most important food resources for this species are the seeds of pines pinus sp principally the two cold climate high altitude species of white pine pinus subgenus strobus with large seeds p albicaulis and p flexilis but also using other high altitude species like p balfouriana p longaeva and p monticola during migrations to lower altitudes it also extensively uses the seeds of pinyon pines the isolated cerro potosí population is strongly associated with the local endemic potosi pinyon pinus culminicola all clarks nutcrackers have a sublingual pouch capable of holding around 50–150 seeds depending on the size of the seeds 2  the pouch greatly enhances the birds ability to transport and store seedsclarks nutcrackers store seeds usually in the ground for later consumption in caches of 1–15 seeds average of 3–4 seeds 2  depending on the cone crop as well as the tree species a single clarks nutcracker can cache as many as 98000 seeds per season 3  the birds regularly store more than they actually need as an insurance against seed theft by other animals squirrels etc as well as low availability of alternative foods this surplus seed is left in the cache and may be able to germinate and grow into new trees if the conditions are right through this activity of caching and over storing the bird is perpetuating its own habitat closely tied in with this storage behavior is the birds remarkable long term spatial memory they are able to relocate caches of seeds with remarkable accuracy even nine months later 4  and even when the cache sites are buried under up to a meter 3 ft of snowthe diet also includes a wide range of insect prey berries and other fruits small mammals and occasionally flesh from carcasses eggs and nestlings are sometimes devoured and peanuts and suet have become a favorite at bird tables food is taken both from the ground and from trees where the nutcrackers are very agile among the branches the birds are able to extract food by clasping pine cones in such a way that the cones are held between one or both feet the birds then hack the cones open with their strong bills rotten logs are also hacked into in order to locate large beetle grubs and animal dung may be flipped over in search of insects clarks nutcrackers can also be opportunistic feeders in developed areas and are known to some as camp robbersnesting edit the species usually nests in pines or other types of conifers during early spring two to four eggs are laid incubation usually occurring in 16–18 days incubation is performed by both the male and female parents and the young are typically fledged by around the 22nd day the fledglings follow their parents around for several months possibly in order to learn the complex seed storage behaviora clarks nutcracker nestled on a branch at crater lake national park in oregonwhitebark pine mutualism edit clarks nutcracker is the primary seed disperser for whitebark pine pinus albicaulis 5  whitebark pine is in decline throughout its range due to infection by white pine blister rust cronartium ribicola widespread outbreaks of mountain pine beetle and the long term effects of fire suppression 6  the clarks nutcracker is an integral part of the whitebark pine restoration process the clarks nutcracker must remain in whitebark pine forests and cache the seeds in excess so that healthy whitebark pine will continue to grow 6  if whitebark pine declines into extinction the clarks nutcracker will lose an important source of

white breasted nuthatch   wikipedia the white breasted nuthatch sitta carolinensis is a small songbird of the nuthatch family which breeds in old growth woodland across much of temperate north america it is a stocky bird with a large head short tail powerful bill and strong feet the upperparts are pale blue gray and the face and underparts are white it has a black cap and a chestnut lower belly the nine subspecies differ mainly in the color of the body plumagelike other nuthatches the white breasted nuthatch forages for insects on trunks and branches and is able to move head first down trees seeds form a substantial part of its winter diet as do acorns and hickory nuts that were stored by the bird in the fall the nest is in a hole in a tree and the breeding pair may smear insects around the entrance as a deterrent to squirrels adults and young may be killed by hawks owls and snakes and forest clearance may lead to local habitat loss but this is a common species with no major conservation concerns over most of its rangetaxonomy edit the nuthatches are a genus sitta of small passerine birds which derive their english name from the propensity of some species to wedge large insects or seeds into cracks and then hack at them with their strong bills 4  sitta is derived from sittē the ancient greek for nuthatch 5  and carolinensis means of carolina in latin the white breasted nuthatch was first described by english ornithologist john latham in his 1790 work the index ornithologicus 6 nuthatch taxonomy is complex with geographically separated species sometimes closely resembling each other the white breasted nuthatch has an appearance and contact call similar to those of the white cheeked nuthatch sitta leucopsis of the himalayas and was formerly considered to be conspecific with it 2  a study published in 2012 showed that four distinct lineages were genetically isolated from each other and could represent different species recognizable by morphology and song 7  a molecular phylogeny published in 2014 and including all main species lineages within nuthatches concluded that the white breasted nuthatch was more closely related to the giant nuthatch s magna than to s przewalskii formerly regarded as possibly conspecific with it s przewalskii turned out to be basal in the family 8 description edit tail displayed s c carolinensislike other members of its genus the white breasted nuthatch has a large head short tail short wings a powerful bill and strong feet it is 13–14 cm 51–55 in long with a wingspan of 20–27 cm 79–106 in and a weight of 18–30 g 063–106 oz 3 the adult male of the nominate subspecies s c carolinensis has pale blue gray upperparts a glossy black cap crown of the head and a black band on the upper back the wing coverts and flight feathers are very dark gray with paler fringes and the closed wing is pale gray and black with a thin white wing bar the face and the underparts are white the outer tail feathers are black with broad diagonal white bands across the outer three feathers a feature readily visible in flight 2 the female has on average a narrower black back band slightly duller upperparts and buffer underparts than the male her cap may be gray but many females have black caps and cannot be reliably distinguished from the male in the field in the northeastern united states at least 10 of females have black caps but the proportion rises to 40–80 in the rocky mountains mexico and the southeastern us juveniles are similar to the adult but duller plumaged 2 like other nuthatches this is a noisy species with a range of vocalizations the males mating song is a rapid nasal qui qui qui qui qui qui qui the contact call between members of a pair given most frequently in the fall and winter is a thin squeaky nit uttered up to 30 times a minute a more distinctive sound is a shrill kri repeated rapidly with mounting anxiety or excitement kri kri kri kri kri kri kri kri the rocky mountains and great basin subspecies have a higher faster yididitititit call 2  and pacific birds a more nasal beeerf 9 three other significantly smaller nuthatches have ranges which overlap that of white breasted but none has white plumage completely surrounding the eye further distinctions are that the red breasted nuthatch has a black eye line and reddish underparts and the brown headed and pygmy nuthatches each have a brown cap and a white patch on the nape of the neck 9 geographical variation edit the white breasted nuthatch has nine subspecies although the differences are small and change gradually across the range the subspecies are sometimes treated as three groups based on close similarities in morphology habitat usage and vocalizations these groups cover eastern north america the great basin and central mexico and the pacific coastal regions 9  the subspecies of the western interior have the darkest upperparts and eastern s c carolinensis has the palest back 2  the eastern form also has a thicker bill and broader dark cap stripe than the interior and pacific races the calls of the three groups differ as described above 9  the great basin and eastern forms have been observed in

habitat in the northeastthe breeding habitat of the white breasted nuthatch is woodland across north america from southern canada to northern florida and southern mexico in the eastern part of its range its preferred habitat is old growth open deciduous or mixed forest including orchards parks suburban gardens and cemeteries it is found mainly in the lowlands although it breeds at 1675 m 5495 ft altitude in tennessee in the west and mexico this nuthatch is found in open montane pine oak woodlands and nesting occurs at up to 3200 m 10500 ft altitude in nevada california and mexico 2  pinyon juniper and riverside woodlands may be used locally where available 10  the white breasted nuthatch is the only north american nuthatch usually found in deciduous trees red breasted pygmy and brown headed nuthatches prefer pines 9 the presence of mature or decaying trees with holes suitable for nesting is essential and trees such as oak beech and hickory are favored in the east since they provide edible seeds 2  although suitable habitat is distributed continentally it is discontinuous and the separate populations of this non migratory species have diverged to form distinct regional subspecies 11 this nuthatch like most of its genus is non migratory and the adults normally stay in their territory year round there may be more noticeable dispersal due to seed failure or high reproductive success in some years 12  and this species has occurred as a vagrant to vancouver island santa cruz island and bermuda one bird landed on the rms queen mary six hours sailing east of new york city in october 1963 2 behavior edit breeding edit an adult at nest entrance feeding its nestlingsthe white breasted nuthatch is monogamous and pairs form following a courtship in which the male bows to the female spreading his tail and drooping his wings while swaying back and forth he also feeds her morsels of food 12  the pair establish a territory of 01–015 km2 25–37 acres in woodland and up to 02 km2 49 acres in semi wooded habitats and then remain together year round until one partner dies or disappears 13  the nest cavity is usually a natural hole in a decaying tree sometimes an old woodpecker nest 2 the nest hole is usually 3–12 m 98–394 ft high in a tree and is lined with fur fine grass and shredded bark the clutch is 5 to 9 eggs which are creamy white speckled with reddish brown and average 19 mm × 14 mm 075 in × 055 in in size the eggs are incubated by the female for 13 to 14 days prior to hatching and the altricial chicks fledge in a further 18 to 26 days 3  both adults feed the chicks in the nest and for about two weeks after fledging and the male also feeds the female while she is incubating once independent juveniles leave the adults territory and either establish their own territory or become floaters unpaired birds without territories it is probably these floaters which are mainly involved in the irregular dispersals of this species this species of nuthatch roosts in tree holes or behind loose bark when not breeding and has the unusual habit of removing its feces from the roost site in the morning it usually roosts alone except in very cold weather when up to 29 birds have been recorded together 2 predation edit predators of adult nuthatches include owls and diurnal birds of prey such as sharp shinned and coopers hawks and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers small squirrels and climbing snakes such as the western rat snake the white breasted nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making hn hn calls when a bird leaves the nest hole it wipes around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation this makes it more difficult for a predator to find the nest using its sense of smell 13  the nuthatch may also smear blister beetles around the entrance to its nest and it has been suggested that the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels its chief competitor for natural tree cavities 14  the estimated average lifespan of this nuthatch is two years 13  but the record is twelve years and nine months 12 this nuthatchs responses to predators may be linked to a reproductive strategy a study compared the white breasted nuthatch with the red breasted nuthatch in terms of the willingness of males to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of predators the models were of a sharp shinned hawk which hunts adult nuthatches and a house wren which destroys eggs 15  the white breasted nuthatch is shorter lived than the red breasted nuthatch but has more young and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator whereas the red breasted showed greater concern with the hawk this supports the theory that longer lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods 15 feeding edit the white breasted nuthatch forages along tree trunks and branches in a similar way to woodpeckers and treecreepers but does not use its tail for additional support instead progressing in jerky hops using its strong legs and feet all nuthatches are distinctive when seeking food because they are able to descend tree trunks head first and can hang upside down beneath twigs and branches 16  17 this nuthatch is omnivorous eating insects and seeds it places large food items such as acorns or hickory nuts in crevices in tree trunks and then hammers them open with its strong beak surplus seeds are cached under loose bark or crevices of trees 12  the diet in winter may be nearly 70 seeds but in summer it is mainly insects the insects consumed by the white breasted nuthatch include caterpillars ants and pest species such as pine weevils oystershell and other scale insects and jumping plant lice 13  18  19  this bird will occasionally feed on the ground and readily visits feeding stations for nuts suet and sunflower seeds the last of which it often takes away to store 12  the white breasted nuthatch was also observed visiting raccoon latrines in order to find seeds 20 the white breasted nuthatch often travels with small mixed flocks in winter these flocks are led by titmice and chickadees with nuthatches and downy woodpeckers as common attendant species participants in such flocks are thought to benefit in terms of foraging and predator avoidance it is likely that the attendant species also access the information carried in the chickadees calls and reduce their own level of vigilance accordingly 21 bird feeders provide a supplementary source of foodthe white breasted nuthatch is a common species with a large range estimated at 8600000 km2 3300000 sq mi its total population is estimated at 10 million individuals and there is evidence of an overall population increase so it is not believed to approach either the size criterion fewer than 10000 mature individuals or the population decline criterion declining more than 30 in ten years or three generations of the iucn red list for these reasons the species is evaluated as least concern 1 the removal of dead trees from forests may cause problems locally for this species because it requires cavity sites for nesting declines have been noted in washington florida and more widely in the southeastern us west to texas in contrast the breeding range is expanding in alberta and numbers are increasing in the northeast due to regrown forest 2  22  23  this nuthatch is protected under the migratory bird treaty act of 1918 to which the three countries in which it occurs canada mexico and the united states are all signatories 13 references edit  a b birdlife international 2012 sitta carolinensis iucn red list of threatened species version 20132

baltimore oriole   wikipedia this article is about the new world blackbird for the major league baseball team see baltimore oriolesthe baltimore oriole icterus galbula is a small icterid blackbird common in eastern north america as a migratory breeding bird it received its name from the resemblance of the males colors to those on the coat of arms of lord baltimore observations of interbreeding between the baltimore oriole and the western bullocks oriole icterus bullockii led to both being classified as a single species called the northern oriole from 1973 1995 research by james rising a professor of zoology at the university of toronto and others showed that the two birds actually did not interbreed significantly 2 the baltimore oriole is the state bird of maryland it is also the inspiration for the baltimore orioles baseball teametymology edit like all new world orioles this species is named after an unrelated physically similar family found in the old world the oriolidae oriole ultimately derives from latin aureolus golden 3  the genus name icterus is from ancient greek ikteros a yellow bird usually taken to be the eurasian golden oriole the sight of which could cure jaundice the specific galbula is the latin name for a yellow bird again usually assumed to be the golden oriole 4 description edit this medium sized passerine measures 17–22 cm 67–87 in in length and spans 23–32 cm 91–126 in across the wings their build is typical of icterids as they have a sturdy body a longish tail fairly long legs and a thick pointed bill the body weight averages 338 g 119 oz with a range of weights from 223 to 42 g 079 to 148 oz 5  the male oriole is slightly larger than the female although the size dimorphism is minimal by icterid standards 6  7  8  adults always have white bars on the wings the adult male is orange on the underparts shoulder patch and rump with some birds appearing a very deep flaming orange and others appearing yellowish orange all of the rest of the males plumage is black the adult female is yellow brown on the upper parts with darker wings and dull orange yellow on the breast and belly the juvenile oriole is similar looking to the female with males taking until the fall of their second year to reach adult plumagedistribution and habitat edit juvenile in maryland united statesbaltimore orioles are found in the nearctic in summer primarily the eastern united states they breed from minnesota to maine and south to central mississippi and alabama and northern georgia they migrate to winter in the neotropics as far north as mexico and sometimes the southern coast of the united states but predominantly in central america and northern south america some areas of the southern united states may retain orioles all winter if they have feeders that appeal to them the range of this bird overlaps with that of the similar bullocks oriole in the midwest and the two species were once considered to be conspecific under the name northern oriole because they form fertile hybrids the baltimore oriole is a rare vagrant to western europebaltimore orioles are often found high up in large leafy deciduous trees but do not generally reside in deep forests the species has been found in summer and migration in open woodland forest edge and partially wooded wetlands or stands of trees along rivers they are very adaptable and can breed in a variety of secondary habitats in recent times they are often found in orchards farmland urban parks and suburban landscapes as long as they retain woodlots in mexico they winter in flowering canopy trees often over shade coffee plantations 9 behavior edit the male sings a loud flutey whistle with a buzzy bold quality a familiar sound in much of the eastern united states the male typically sings from the tree canopy often giving away its location before being sightedbreeding edit baltimore orioles are basically solitary outside their mating season the species is generally considered monogamous although evidence suggests that extra pair copulation is reasonably common in the spring males establish a territory then display to females by singing and chattering while hopping from perch to perch in front of them males also give a bow display bowing with wings lowered and tail fanned depending on their receptiveness the females may ignore these displays or sing and give calls or a wing quiver display in response the wing quiver display involves leaning forward often with tail partly fanned and fluttering or quivering slightly lowered wingsthe baltimore orioles nest is built by the female it is a tightly woven pouch located on the end of a branch consisting of any plant or animal materials available hanging down on the underside trees such as elms cottonwoods maples willows or apples are regularly selected with the nest usually located around 7 to 9 m 23 to 30 ft above the ground the female lays three to seven eggs with the norm being around four the eggs are pale gray to bluish white measuring 23 cm × 16 cm 091 in × 063 in on average the incubation period is 12 to 14 days once the nestlings hatch they are fed by regurgitation by both parents and brooded by the female for two weeks after this the young start to fledge becoming largely independent shortly thereafter if the eggs young or nest are destroyed the oriole is unable to lay a replacement clutch 9 mortality edit predation is a common source of mortality typically also occurring with eggs nestlings and fledgings common predators at baltimore oriole nests can include common grackles american crows blue jays black billed magpies tree squirrels and domestic cats which most commonly capture newly fledged orioles or adults engaged in brooding behavior rapacious birds commonly prey on both young and fully grown orioles the most prolific being the eastern screech owl and coopers and sharp shinned hawks somewhat larger rapacious birds also sometimes opportunistically predate the oriole including peregrine falcons great horned owls and barn owls while merlins may do so while orioles are migrating 10  11 the record lifespan for a wild bird was 11 years and 7 months with captive orioles living up to 14 yearsfeeding edit baltimore orioles forage in trees and shrubs also making short flights to catch insects they acrobatically clamber hover and hang among foliage as they comb high branches they mainly eat insects berries and nectar and are often seen sipping at hummingbird feeders their favored prey is perhaps the forest tent caterpillar moth which they typically eat in their larval stage and can be a nuisance species if not naturally regulated by predation the larvae caterpillar are beaten against a branch until their protective hairs are skinned off before being eaten unlike american robins and many other fruit eating birds baltimore orioles seem to prefer only ripe dark colored fruit orioles seek out the darkest mulberries the reddest cherries and the deepest purple grapes and will ignore green grapes and yellow cherries even if they are ripe baltimore orioles sometimes use their bills in an unusual way called gaping they stab the closed bill into soft fruits then open their mouths to cut a juicy swath from which they drink with their tongues during spring and fall nectar fruit and other sugary foods are readily converted into fat which supplies energy for migrationmany people now attract baltimore orioles to their backyards with oriole feeders such feeders contain essentially the same food as hummingbird feeders but are designed for orioles and are orange instead of red and have larger perches baltimore orioles are also fond of halved oranges grape jelly and in their winter quarters the red arils of gumbo limbo bursera simaruba 12  if they discover a well kept feeder orioles lead their young there birdlife international 2012 icterus galbula iucn red list of threatened species version 20132 international

ovenbird   wikipedia the ovenbird seiurus aurocapilla is a small songbird of the new world warbler family parulidae this migratory bird breeds in eastern north america and winters in central america many caribbean islands florida and northern venezuela 2  3 taxonomy edit the genus seiurus is currently treated as monotypic containing only the ovenbird it is genetically distinct from all other species in the family parulidae probably the first genus to evolve separately from the rest of the family 4 before the recent genetic studies were carried out the waterthrushes were also included in seiurus 3  5  these are now treated separately in the genus parkesia as they are not very closely related to the ovenbird 4 the species name aurocapilla is a noun phrase so the original spelling is retained not changed according to the gender of the genus name linnaeus originally named it motacilla aurocapilla and the ending is not changed to  us as commonly cited in the past 6  etymologically aurocapilla comes from latin and means golden haired and seiurus is from ancient greek seio to shake and urus tail 7 description edit ovenbirds are large wood warblers and is sometimes confused by the untrained for a thrush adults measure 11–16 cm 43–63 in long and span 19–26 cm 75–102 in across the wings 8  9  10  they weigh 19 g 067 oz on average 11  with a range of 14–288 g 049–102 oz 8  among standard measurements the wing chord is 68 to 83 cm 27 to 33 in the tail is 5 to 58 cm 20 to 23 in the bill is 11 to 13 cm 043 to 051 in and the tarsus is 2 to 23 cm 079 to 091 in 3  they tend to be heavier in winter and particularly at the start of their migration 12  they have olive brown upperparts and white underparts heavily streaked with black the flanks have an olive hue a white ring surrounds the eyes and a black stripe runs below the cheek they have a line of orange feathers with olive green tips running along the top of their head bordered on each side with blackish brown the orange feathers can be erected to form a small crest the eyes and the upper part of the thin pointed beak are dark while the lower beak is horn colored and the legs and feet are pinkish 2 males and females look alike immature birds have tawny fringes to the tertiary remiges and sometimes buff tipped outer primary wing coverts most conspicuously the olive green tips of the crown feathers which are hardly visible in adult birds are far larger in extent in immatures and cover the orange crown stripe almost or completely 2 the main song of the ovenbird is a series of strident relatively low pitched bisyallabic motives repeated without pause about eight times and increasing in volume usually the second syllable in each motive is sharply accented chur tee’ chur tee’ chur tee’ chur tee’ chur tee chur tee chur tee male ovenbirds utter a sweet chattering song in the air at twilight after the manner of the skylark 13  incorporating portions of the main song into a jumble of sputtering notes and mimicry as they dive back to earth the call is a variably pitched sharp chik some variations recall the common call note of a downy woodpecker if the bird is excited it may repeat this call several times 2  the fight call is a high rising siiiirange and ecology edit their breeding habitats are mature deciduous and mixed forests especially sites with little undergrowth across canada and the eastern united states for foraging it prefers woodland with abundant undergrowth of shrubs essentially it thrives best in a mix of primary and secondary forest ovenbirds migrate to the southeastern united states the caribbean and from mexico to northern south america the birds are territorial all year round occurring either singly or in the breeding season as mated pairs for a short time accompanied by their young during migration they tend to travel in larger groups however dispersing again once they reach their destination 2 in winter they dwell mainly in lowlands but may ascend up to 1500 m 4900 ft asl eg in costa rica the first migrants leave in late august and appear on the wintering grounds as early as september with successive waves arriving until late october or so they depart again to breed between late march and early may arriving on the breeding grounds throughout april and may migration times do not seem to have changed much over the course of the 20th century 2  14  15 this bird seems just capable of crossing the atlantic as there have been a handful of records in norway ireland and great britain however half of the six finds were of dead birds a live ovenbird on st marys isles of scilly in october 2004 was in bad condition and died despite being taken into care 16 ovenbirds forage on the ground in dead leaves sometimes hovering or catching insects in flight this bird frequently tilts its tail up and bobs its head while walking at rest the tail may be flicked up and slowly lowered again and alarmed birds flick the tail frequently from a half raised position these birds mainly eat terrestrial arthropods and snails and also include fruit 17  in their diet during winter 2 the nest referred to as the oven which gives the bird its name is a domed structure placed on the ground woven from vegetation and containing a side entrance both parents feed the young birds the placement of the nest on the ground makes predation by chipmunks tamias a greater concern than for tree nesting birds chipmunks have been known to burrow directly into the nest to eat the young birds 3 the ovenbird is vulnerable to nest parasitism by the brown headed cowbird molothrus ater which is becoming more plentiful in some areas however the ovenbirds numbers appear to be remaining stable altogether it is not considered a threatened species by the iucn 1  3 in literature edit it is the subject of a poem by robert frost the oven bird published in his poetry collection mountain interval in 1916 robert bly also makes reference to the nimble oven

brown pelican   wikipedia the brown pelican pelecanus occidentalis is a small pelican found in the americas it is one of the best known and most prominent birds found in the coastal areas of the southern and western united states it is one of only three pelican species found in the western hemisphere the brown pelican is one of the only two pelican species which feeds by diving into the waterdescription edit the brown pelican is the smallest of the eight species of pelican although it is a large bird in nearly every other regard it is 106–137 cm 42–54 in in length weighs from 275 to 55 kg 61 to 121 lb and has a wingspan from 183 to 25 m 60 to 82 ft through most of its range the brown pelican is an unmistakable bird like all pelicans this species has a very large bill 28 to 348 cm 110 to 137 in long in this case with a gular pouch on the bottom for draining water when it scoops out prey 2  the head is white but often gets a yellowish wash in adult birds the bill is grayish overall in most birds though breeding birds become reddish on the underside of the throat the back rump and tail are streaked with gray and dark brown sometimes with a rusty hue in adult pelicans the breast and belly are a blackish brown and the legs and feet are black the juvenile is similar but has a brownish gray neck and white underpartsthis bird is readily distinguished from the american white pelican by its non white plumage smaller size and its habit of diving for fish from the air as opposed to co operative fishing from the surface the peruvian pelican previously considered a subspecies of brown pelican is now considered to be a separate species it has very similar plumage to the brown but it is noticeably larger the brown and peruvian pelicans may overlap in some areas along the pacific coast of south americapelecanus occidentalis urinator laying in tortuga bay galápagos ecuadoreating fish in galápagosrange and habitats edit the brown pelican lives on both coasts in the americas on the atlantic coast and gulf coast they distribute from nova scotia to venezuela and to the mouth of the amazon river along the atlantic they are usually less common north of the carolinas with a considerable population in much of the gulf of mexico on the pacific ocean they are found from british columbia to south central chile and including the galapagos islands 3  in the pacific they are fairly common along the coast of california mexico and central america some immature birds may stray to inland freshwater lakes after nesting north american birds move in flocks further north along the coasts returning to warmer waters for winter they are also common in mangrove swampsbehavior edit pelicans are very gregarious birds they live in flocks of both sexes throughout the year they are exceptionally buoyant due to the internal air sacks beneath their skin and in their bones and as graceful in the air as they are clumsy on land in level flight pelicans fly in groups with their heads held back on their shoulders the bills resting on their folded necks they may fly in a v but usually in regular lines or single file often low over the waters surfacewhen foraging they dive bill first like a kingfisher 4  often submerging completely below the surface momentarily as they snap up prey upon surfacing they spill the water from the throat pouch before swallowing their catch only the peruvian pelican shares this active foraging style while other pelicans forage more inactively by scooping up corralled fish while swimming on the surface of the water juvenile brown pelicans have been observed foraging in the surface swimming matter of other pelicans they are occasional targets of kleptoparasitism by other fish eating birds such as gulls skuas and frigatebirds 5 although the brown pelican eats mostly fish an occasional amphibian or crustacean may supplement the diet menhaden may locally account for 90–95 of their food the anchovy supply is particularly important to the nesting success of the brown pelican 6  however their preferred prey are usually not commercially fished species 5  other fish preyed on with some regularity can include pigfish pinfish herring sheepshead silversides mullet and minnows and they sometimes eat crustaceans usually prawns a single adult pelican can eat up to 18 kg 40 lb each day 7  today in many coastal areas brown pelicans will loaf around fishing ports and piers in hopes of being fed or stealing scraps of fish especially if conditioned to do 5 breeding edit juvenile brown pelican in flight bodega head californiathese birds nest in colonies often on islands andor in mangroves male pelicans pick out the nesting sites and perform an advertising display which attracts the females once a pair forms a bond overt communication between them is minimal pelican nesting peaks during march and april nests are in colonies either in trees bushes or on the ground the latter usually on islands that terrestrial predators cannot access those placed in trees are rather flimsy and made of reeds grasses straw and sticks if on the ground nests consist of a shallow scrape lined with feathers and a rim of soil built 10–26 cm 39–102 in above the ground their young are hatched in broods of about 2–3 and are naked and helpless upon hatching incubation is roughly 28–30 days both parents actively care for the young young pelicans start to walk independently at about 35 days old in ground nest but do not leave treetop nests for up to 68–88 days in the 8–10 month period they are cared for the nestling pelicans are fed by regurgitation around 70 kg 150 lb of fish the younger birds reach sexual maturity and full adult plumage at anywhere from two to five years of age predation is occasional at colonies and predators of eggs young and the rare adult pelicans can include gulls raptors especially bald eagles foxes skunks and feral cats 8  in areas where their ranges overlap american alligators may sometimes pick off fledging pelicans predation is likely reduced if the colony is on an island like all pelicans brown pelicans are highly sensitive to disturbances by humans often tourists or fishermen at their nest and may abandon their nest if stressed as such 5  due to their size the non nesting adults are rarely predated 9 state bird edit the brown pelican is the state bird of louisiana it is also the national bird of saint kittsthreats and conservation edit pesticides like ddt and dieldrin threatened the brown pelicans future in the southeastern united states and california in the early 1970s and led to its listing under the us endangered species act from 1970 to 2009 a research group from the university of tampa headed by dr ralph schreiber conducted research in the tampa bayst petersburg area and found that ddt caused the pelican eggshells to be too thin and incapable of supporting the embryo to maturity as a result of this research ddt usage was eliminated in florida followed by the rest of the us along with the american white pelican the brown pelican is protected by the migratory bird treaty act of 1918the international union for conservation of natures red list has listed the brown pelican as least concern since 1988 1  the us government imposed a ban on the use of ddt in 1972 since then the population of brown pelican has

buff bellied pipit   wikipedia the buff bellied pipit anthus rubescens or american pipit as it is known in north america is a small songbird found on both sides of the northern pacific it was first described by marmaduke tunstall in his 1771 ornithologia britannica 2  it was formerly classified as a form of the water pipitdescription edit like most other pipits the buff bellied pipit is an undistinguished looking species which usually can be seen to run around on the ground the rubescens subspecies or american pipit has lightly streaked grey brown upperparts and is diffusely streaked below on the buff breast and flanks the belly is whitish the bill and legs are dark the japonicus subspecies or japanese pipit is darker above and has bolder black streaking on its whiter underparts its legs have a reddish hue 3  4  the call is a squeaky sip 4 taxonomy edit the scientific name is from latin anthus is the name for a small bird of grasslands and the specific rubescens means reddish from ruber ruddy 5 it has two distinctive subspecies but morphological and dna sequence differences between them are rather pronounced and they might be considered distinct species pending further research 4  6 a r rubescens   tunstall 1771 american pipit – breeds in northern north america extending further south in mountainous areasa r japonicus   temminck amp schlegel 1847 japanese pipit or siberian pipit – breeds in most of eastern temperate asia including japanthis species is closely related to eurasian rock pipit a petrosus and water pipit a spinoletta all three forms having previously been considered conspecific they can be differentiated by their vocalizations and some visual cues but rock and buff bellied pipit are not found sympatrically except as vagrant individuals and the ranges of buff bellied and water pipits overlap only in a small area in central asia 3  7  8 anthus rubescens   buff bellied pipit   xc111042behavior edit both subspecies of the buff bellied pipit are migratory the buff bellied pipit winters on the pacific coast of north america and on the atlantic coast from the southern north america to central america 1  at least regarding the buff bellied pipit its wintering range seems to have expanded northwards in the 20th century and the birds seem to spend less time in winter quarters in northern ohio for example the species was recorded as not common during migration in may and septemberoctober in the 1900s decade but today it is considered a widespread migrant in that region found between march and may and from late september to november with many birds actually wintering this far north asian birds winter mainly from pakistan east to and southeast asia with occasional birds found as far north as yunnan and some in japan apparently being all year residents or migrating but a little the american and asian subspecies are rare vagrants to western and eastern europe respectively 4  9  10  11 like its relatives this species is insectivorous the breeding habitat of buff bellied pipit is tundra but outside the breeding season it is found in open lightly vegetated areas similar to those favoured by the water pipit a spinoletta 4 reproduction from pairing to fledging edit the first thing buff bellied pipits do when they arrive on the breeding site during snowmelt is pairing indeed males will start to fight one on one to win over the female and pair with it during the entire breeding season they also fight for the snow free sites that would be better for nesting the moment is also very important because the melting snow implies an increase in arthropods abundance which constitute the main food source for these birds after the fight and the pairing nesting is the next step nests are most often found on the ground in dry or wet meadows always with a helpful protection but they are never placed in shrubs or trees 12  13  the composition of the ideal nest depends on whatever is around the nesting area but it is usually made of sedge remains or new fine grass and sometimes some horse hairs 13  the final issue buff bellied pipits have to deal with is nest success the nest is indeed the target for numerous predators such as ants or hawks if this step is successful an egg can be produced 13  the female will not lay an egg if the conditions such as temperature and nesting site are not optimal if the first attempt fails her time to lay an egg is reduced in general buff bellied pipits continuously lay eggs over a period of 4 to 5 days after snow melt in april–may until mid july after this period the male testes decrease in size and the female refuses any copulation 14  the clutch size is usually 5 eggs but it can vary according to snowfalls the parents’ reproductive ability and predation 12  eggs are incubated for 13–14 days 14  15  during this time the female does not leave the nest but is still very reactive to any movement around her she communicates by singing to the male that brings her food and defends their territory four or five days after hatching the young is skinny blue gray in color and only has its secondary feathers for a week the female will brood the clutch but both parents will feed them after these 7 days the birds are ready for fledging but they will still be fed by their parents for 14 days after their departure finally immature birds will form little flocks with other immature birds and wander off 13  15 it is a widespread and common species and not considered threatened by the iucn 1 references edit  a b c birdlife international 2013

eastern whip poor will   wikipedia the eastern whip poor will antrostomus vociferus is a medium sized 22–27 cm nightjar from north america the whip poor will is commonly heard within its range but less often seen because of its superior camouflage it is named onomatopoeically after its song 2 description edit this medium sized nightjar measures 22–27 cm 87–106 in in length spans 45–50 cm 18–20 in across the wings and weighs 42–69 g 15–24 oz 3  further standard measurements are a wing chord of 147 to 169 cm 58 to 67 in a tail of 105 to 128 cm 41 to 50 in a bill of 1 to 14 cm 039 to 055 in and a tarsus of 15 to 18 cm 059 to 071 in 4  adults have mottled plumage the upperparts are grey black and brown the lower parts are grey and black they have a very short bill and a black throat males have a white patch below the throat and white tips on the outer tail feathers in the female these parts are light brownthis bird is sometimes confused 5  with the related chuck wills widow antrostomus carolinensis which has a similar but lower pitched and slower callecology edit eastern whip poor wills breed in deciduous or mixed woods across central and southeastern canada and the eastern united states and migrate to the southeastern united states and to eastern mexico and central america for the winter these birds forage at night catching insects in flight and normally sleep during the day eastern whip poor wills nest on the ground in shaded locations among dead leaves and usually lay two eggs at a time the bird will commonly remain on the nest unless almost stepped uponthe eastern whip poor will is becoming locally rare several reasons for the decline are proposed such as habitat destruction predation by feral cats and dogs and poisoning by insecticides but the actual causes remain elusive 6  full citation needed  even with local populations endangered the species as a whole is not considered globally threatened due to its large range 7  full citation needed the whip poor will has been split into two species eastern populations are now referred to as the eastern whip poor will the disjunct population in southwestern united states and mexico is now referred to as the mexican whip poor will antrostomus arizonae the two populations were split based on range different vocalizations different egg coloration and dna sequencing showing differentiation 8 cultural references edit due to its haunting ethereal song the eastern whip poor will is the topic of numerous legends one new england legend says the whip poor will can sense a soul departing and can capture it as it flees this is used as a plot device in h p lovecrafts story the dunwich horror lovecraft based this idea on information of local legends given to him by edith miniter of north wilbraham massachusetts when he visited her in 1928 this is likely related to an earlier native american and general american folk belief that the singing of the birds is a death omen 9  this is also referred by whip poor will a short story by james thurber in which the constant nighttime singing of a whip poor will results in maddening insomnia of the protagonist mr kinstrey who eventually loses his mind and kills everyone in his house including himself the bird also features however in the runaway slave at pilgrims point a poem by the english poet elizabeth barrett browning in which the outcast speaker asks could the whip poor will or the cat of the glenlook into my eyes and be bold 10 it is also frequently used as an auditory symbol of rural america as in washington irvings story the legend of sleepy hollow or as a plot device for example william faulkners short story barn burning makes several mentions of whip poor wills eg and then he found that he had been asleep because he knew it was almost dawn the night almost over he could tell that from the whip poor wills they were everywhere now among the dark trees below him constant and inflectioned and ceaseless so that as the instant for giving over to the day birds drew nearer and nearer there was no interval at all between them 11 the mountain whippoorwill is a poem written by stephen vincent benet about a fiddling contest won by hillbilly jim who refers to his fiddle as a whip poor will and identifies the bird with the lonely and poor but vibrant life of the mountain people american poet robert frost described the sound of a whip poor will in the fourth stanza of his 1915 poem ghost house this is notable in frosts use of assonance in the whippoorwill is coming to shout  and hush and cluck and flutter about 12 in the 1934 frank capra film it happened one night before clark gables character peter warne reveals his name to ellie andrews claudette colbert he famously says to her i am the whip poor will that

common raven   wikipedia the common raven corvus corax also known as the northern raven is a large all black passerine bird found across the northern hemisphere it is the most widely distributed of all corvids there are at least eight subspecies with little variation in appearance although recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various regions it is one of the two largest corvids alongside the thick billed raven and is possibly the heaviest passerine bird at maturity the common raven averages 63 centimetres 25 inches in length and 12 kilograms 26 pounds in mass common ravens can live up to 21 years in the wild 2  a lifespan exceeded among passerines by only a few australasian species such as the satin bowerbird 3  and probably the lyrebirds young birds may travel in flocks but later mate for life with each mated pair defending a territorycommon ravens have coexisted with humans for thousands of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people have regarded them as pests part of their success as a species is due to their omnivorous diet they are extremely versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition feeding on carrion insects cereal grains berries fruit small animals and food wastesome notable feats of problem solving provide evidence that the common raven is unusually intelligent over the centuries it has been the subject of mythology folklore art and literature in many cultures including the indigenous cultures of scandinavia ancient ireland and wales bhutan the northwest coast of north america and siberia and northeast asia the common raven has been revered as a spiritual figure or god 4 taxonomy edit the common raven was one of the many species originally described by linnaeus in his 18th century work systema naturae and it still bears its original name of corvus corax 5  it is the type species of the genus corvus derived from the latin word for raven 6  the specific epithet coraxκοραξ is the ancient greek word for raven or crow 7 the modern english word raven has cognates in all other germanic languages including old norse and subsequently modern icelandic hrafn 8  and old high german hraban 8  all which descend from proto germanic khrabanas 9  an old scottish word corby or corbie akin to the french corbeau has been used for both this bird and the carrion crow 10  obsolete collective nouns for a group of ravens or at least the common raven include unkindness 11  and conspiracy 12  in practice most people use the more generic flockclassification edit the closest relatives of the common raven are the brown necked raven c ruficollis the pied crow c albus of africa and the chihuahuan raven c cryptoleucus of the north american southwest 13  while some authorities recognized as many as 11 subspecies 14  others only recognize eight 15 subspeciesimagedistributionnotesc c coraxfrom europe eastwards to lake baikal south to the

evolved in the old world and crossed the bering land bridge into north america 20  recent genetic studies which examined the dna of common ravens from across the world have determined that the birds fall into at least two clades a california clade found only in the southwestern united states and a holarctic clade found across the rest of the northern hemisphere birds from both clades look alike but the groups are genetically distinct and began to diverge about two million years ago 21  22 the findings indicate that based on mitochondrial dna common ravens from the rest of the united states are more closely related to those in europe and asia than to those in the california clade and that common ravens in the california clade are more closely related to the chihuahuan raven c cryptoleucus than to those in the holarctic clade 21  ravens in the holarctic clade are more closely related to the pied crow c albus than they are to the california clade 23  thus the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic 23 one explanation for these genetic findings is that common ravens settled in california at least two million years ago and became separated from their relatives in europe and asia during an ice age one million years ago a group from the california clade evolved into a new species the chihuahuan raven other members of the holarctic clade arrived later in a separate migration from asia perhaps at the same time as humans 24 a recent study of raven mitochondrial dna showed that the isolated population from the canary islands is distinct from other populations 25  the study did not include any individuals from the north african population 25  and its position is therefore unclear though its morphology is very close to the population of the canaries to the extent that the two are often considered part of a single subspecies 15 description edit in sunlight the plumage can display a blue or purple sheen which is a result of iridescencea mature common raven ranges between 54 and 67 cm 21 and 26 long with a wingspan of 115 to 130 cm 45 51 26  27  28  29  recorded weights range from 069 to 2 kg 15 to 44 lb 30  31  thus making the common raven one of the heaviest passerines birds from colder regions such as the himalayas and greenland are generally larger with slightly larger bills while those from warmer regions are smaller with proportionally smaller bills 32  representative of the size variation in the species ravens from california weighed an average of 784 g 1728 lb those from alaska weighed an average of 1135 g 2502 lb and those from nova scotia weighed an average of 1230 g 271 lb 33  34  35  the bill is large and slightly curved with a culmen length of 57 to 85 cm 22 to 33 in easily one of the largest bills amongst passerines perhaps only the thick billed raven has a noticeably larger bill it has a longish strongly graduated tail at 20 to 263 cm 79 to 104 in and mostly black iridescent plumage and a dark brown iris the throat feathers are elongated and pointed and the bases of the neck feathers are pale brownish grey the legs and feet are good sized with a tarsus length of 6 to 72 cm 24 to 28 in 36  37  juvenile plumage is similar but duller with a blue grey iris 38 apart from its greater size the common raven differs from its cousins the crows by having a larger and heavier black beak shaggy feathers around the throat and above the beak and a wedge shaped tail 39  flying ravens are distinguished from crows by their tail shape larger wing area and more stable soaring style which generally involves less wing flapping despite their bulk ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins in flight the feathers produce a creaking sound that has been likened to the rustle of silk 18  the voice of ravens is also quite distinct its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crows call in north america the chihuahuan raven c cryptoleucus is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the american southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill beard and body and relatively longer tail all black carrion crow c corone in europe may suggest a raven due to their largish bill but are still distinctly smaller and have the wing and tail shapes typical of crows 40 in the faroe islands a now extinct colour morph of this species existed known as the pied raven 41 white ravens are occasionally found in the wild birds in british columbia lack the pink eyes of an albino and are instead leucistic a condition where an animal lacks any of several different types of pigment not simply melanin 42 common ravens have a wide range of vocalizations which are of interest to ornithologists gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s recording and photographing his findings in great detail 43  fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species most of which are used for social interaction calls recorded include alarm calls chase calls and flight calls the species has a distinctive deep resonant prruk prruk prruk call which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high knocking toc toc toc a dry grating kraa a low guttural rattle and some calls of an almost musical nature 43 like other corvids ravens can mimic sounds from their environment including human speech non vocal sounds produced by the common raven include wing whistles and bill snapping clapping or clicking has been observed more often in females than in males if a member of a pair is lost its mate reproduces the calls of its lost partner to encourage its return 44 distribution and habitat edit common ravens can thrive in varied climates indeed this species has the largest range of any member of the genus 45  46  and one of the largest of any passerine 47  they range throughout the holarctic from arctic and temperate habitats in north america and eurasia to the deserts of north africa and to islands in the pacific ocean in the british isles they are more common in scotland wales northern england and the west of ireland 39  in tibet they have been recorded at altitudes up to 5000 m 16400 ft and as high as 6350 m 20600 ft on mount everest 46  48  the population sometimes known as the punjab raven—described as corvus corax laurencei also spelt lawrencii or laurencii by allan octavian hume but more often considered synonymous with subcorax 16 —is restricted to the sindh district of pakistan and adjoining regions of northwestern india 18  19  except in arctic habitats 49  they are generally resident within their range for the whole year young birds may disperse locally 50 most common ravens prefer wooded areas with large expanses of open land nearby or coastal regions for their nesting sites and feeding grounds in some areas of dense human population such as california in the united states they take advantage of a plentiful food supply and have seen a surge in their numbers 51  on coasts individuals of this species are often evenly distributed and prefer to build their nest sites along sea cliffs 52  common ravens are often located in coastal regions because these areas provide easy access to water and a variety of food sources 52  also coastal regions have stable weather patterns without extreme cold or hot temperaturesin general common ravens live in a wide array of environments but prefer heavily contoured landscapes when the environment changes in vast degrees these birds will respond with a stress response the hormone known as corticosterone is activated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis 53  corticosterone is activated when the bird is exposed to stress such as migrating great distancesbehaviour edit common ravens usually travel in mated pairs although young birds may form flocks relationships between common ravens are often quarrelsome yet they demonstrate considerable devotion to their families 54 common ravens are omnivorous and highly opportunistic their diet may vary widely with location season and serendipity 55  for example those foraging on tundra on the arctic north slope of alaska obtained about half their energy needs from predation mainly of microtine rodents and half by scavenging mainly of caribou and ptarmigan carcasses 56 in some places they are mainly scavengers feeding on carrion as well as the associated maggots and carrion beetles with large bodied carrion which they are not equipped to tear through as well as birds such as hook billed vultures they must wait for the prey to be torn open by another predator or flayed by other means 57  plant food includes cereal grains berries and fruit they prey on small invertebrates amphibians reptiles small mammals and birds 58  ravens may also consume the undigested portions of animal feces and human food waste they store surplus food items especially those containing fat and will learn to hide such food out of the sight of other common ravens 50  ravens also raid the food caches of other species such as the arctic fox 59  they sometimes associate with another canine the grey wolf as a kleptoparasite following to scavenge wolf kills in winter 60  ravens are regular predators at bird nests brazenly picking off eggs nestlings and sometimes adult birds when they spot an opportunity they are considered perhaps the primary natural threat to the nesting success of the critically endangered california condor since they readily take condor eggs and are very common in the areas where the species is being re introduced 61 flock feeding at a garbage dumpcommon ravens nesting near sources of human garbage included a higher percentage of food waste in their diet birds nesting near roads consumed more road killed vertebrates and those nesting far from these sources of food ate more arthropods and plant material fledging success was higher for those using human garbage as a food source 62  in contrast a 1984–1986 study of common raven diet in an agricultural region of south western idaho found that cereal grains were the principal constituent of pellets though small mammals grasshoppers cattle carrion and birds were also eaten 63 one behavior is recruitment where juvenile ravens call other ravens to a food bonanza usually a carcass with a series of loud yells in ravens in winter bernd heinrich posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away 64  a more mundane explanation is that individuals co operate in sharing information about carcasses of large mammals because they are too big for just a few birds to exploit 65  experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent of the size of the bait 66 furthermore there has been research suggesting that the common raven is involved in seed dispersal in the wild the common raven chooses the best habitat and disperses seeds in locations best suited for its survival 52 predation edit owing to its size gregariousness and its defensive abilities the common raven has few natural predators predators of its eggs include owls martens and sometimes eagles ravens are quite vigorous at defending their young and are usually successful at driving off perceived threats they attack potential predators by flying at them and lunging with their large bills humans are occasionally attacked if they get close to a raven nest though serious injuries are unlikely there are a few records of predation by large birds of prey their attackers in america have reportedly included great horned owls northern goshawks bald eagles golden eagles and red tailed hawks it is possible that the two hawks only have attacked young ravens as had a peregrine falcon who in one instance swooped at a newly fledged raven but was successfully chased off by the parent ravens 67  68  69  70  in eurasia their reported predators include in addition to golden eagles eurasian eagle owls white tailed eagles stellers sea eagles eastern imperial eagles and gyrfalcons 71  72  73  74  75  because they are potentially hazardous prey for raptorial birds raptors must usually take them by surprise and most attacks are on fledgling ravens more rarely still large mammalian predators such as lynxes coyotes and cougars have also attacked ravens this principally occurs at a nest site and when other prey for the carnivores are scarce ravens are highly wary around novel carrion sites and in north america have been recorded waiting for the presence of american crows and blue jays before approaching to eat 76 breeding edit young on a nest – hvítserkur icelandjuveniles begin to court at a very early age but may not bond for another two or three years aerial acrobatics demonstrations of intelligence and ability to provide food are key behaviors of courting once paired they tend to nest together for life usually in the same location 54  instances of non monogamy have been observed in common ravens by males visiting a females nest when her mate is away 65 breeding pairs must have a territory of their own before they begin nest building and reproduction and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area 30  the nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs bound with an inner layer of roots mud and bark and lined with a softer material such as deer fur the nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles 77 females lay between three and seven pale bluish green brown blotched eggs 39  incubation is about 18 to 21 days by the female only however the male may stand or crouch over the young sheltering but not actually brooding them 78  young fledge at 35 to 42 days and are fed by both parents they stay with their parents for another six months after fledging 79 in most of their range egg laying begins in late february in colder climates it is later eg april in greenland and tibet in pakistan egg laying takes place in december 46  eggs and hatchlings are preyed on rarely by large hawks and eagles large owls martens and canids the adults which are very rarely predated are often successful in defending their young from these predators due to their numbers large size and cunning 76  they have been observed dropping stones on potential predators that venture close to their nests 80 common ravens can be very long lived especially in captive or protected conditions individuals at the tower of london have lived for more than 40 years 30  lifespans in the wild are considerably shorter at typically 10 to 15 years the longest known lifespan of a banded wild common raven was 23 years 3 months 81 intelligence edit crows ravens magpies and jays are not just feathered machines rigidly programmed by their genetics instead they are beings that within the constraints of their molecular inheritance make complex decisions and show every sign of enjoying a rich awarenessthe brains of common ravens count among the largest of any bird species specifically their hyperpallium is large for a bird they display ability in problem solving as well as other cognitive processes such as imitation and insight 82 dilapidated nike missile radar dome in alaska with an evening roostlinguist derek bickerton building on the work of biologist bernd heinrich has argued that ravens are one of only four known animals the others being bees ants and humans who have demonstrated displacement the capacity to communicate about objects or events that are distant in space or time from the communication young unmated common ravens roost together at night but usually forage alone during the day however when one discovers a large carcass guarded by a pair of adult ravens the unmated raven will return to the roost and communicate the find the following day a flock of unmated ravens will fly to the carcass and chase off the adults bickerton argues that the advent of linguistic displacement was perhaps the most important event in the evolution of human language and that ravens are the only other vertebrate to share this with humans 83 one experiment designed to evaluate insight and problem solving ability involved a piece of meat attached to a string hanging from a perch to reach the food the bird needed to stand on the perch pull the string up a little at a time and step on the loops to gradually shorten the string four of five common ravens eventually succeeded and the transition from no success ignoring the food or merely yanking at the string to constant reliable access pulling up the meat occurred with no demonstrable trial and error learning this supports the hypothesis that common ravens are inventors implying that they can solve problems many of the feats of common ravens were formerly argued to be stereotyped innate behaviour but it now has been established that their aptitudes for solving problems individually and learning from each other reflect a flexible capacity for intelligent insight unusual among non human animals 84 another experiment proved that some could deceive intentionally at least to other common ravens 85 common ravens have been observed calling wolves to the site of dead animals the wolves open the carcass leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds 82  they watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each others food caches so they can steal from them this type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food 86  they have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food presumably to confuse onlookers 87 common ravens are known to steal and cache shiny objects such as pebbles pieces of metal and golf balls one theory is that they hoard shiny objects to impress other ravens 88  other research indicates that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things and that common ravens retain an attraction to bright round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs mature birds lose their intense interest in the unusual and become highly neophobic 89 there has been increasing recognition of the extent to which birds engage in play juvenile common ravens are among the most playful of bird species they have been observed to slide down snowbanks apparently purely for fun they even engage in games with other species such as playing catch me if you can with wolves otters and dogs 90  common ravens are known for spectacular aerobatic displays such as flying in loops or interlocking talons with each other in flight 91  92 they are also one of only a few wild animals who make their own toys they have been observed breaking off twigs to play with socially 93 relationship with humans edit conservation and management edit compared to many smaller corvus species such as american crow ravens prefer undisturbed montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas 94  in other areas their numbers have increased dramatically and they have become agricultural pests common ravens can cause damage to crops such as nuts and grain or can harm livestock particularly by killing young goat kids lambs and calves 95  ravens generally attack the faces of young livestock but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers 96 in the western mojave desert human settlement and land development have led to an estimated 16 fold increase in the common raven population over 25 years towns landfills sewage treatment plants and artificial ponds create sources of food and water for scavenging birds ravens also find nesting sites in utility poles and ornamental trees and are attracted to roadkill on highways the explosion in the common raven population in the mojave has raised concerns for the desert tortoise a threatened species common ravens prey upon juvenile tortoises which have soft shells and move slowly 51  despite this and there being no danger of extinction the us congress added ravens to the migratory bird treaty act of 1918 in 1971 97  plans to control the population have included shooting and trapping birds as well as contacting landfill operators to ask that they reduce the amount of exposed garbage 98  a hunting bounty as a method of control was historically used in finland from the mid 18th century until 1923 99  culling has taken place to a limited extent in alaska where the population increase in common ravens is threatening the vulnerable stellers eider polysticta stelleri 100 cultural depictions edit across its range in the northern hemisphere and throughout human history the common raven has been a powerful symbol and a popular subject of mythology and folklorein some western traditions ravens have long been considered to be birds of ill omen death and evil in general in part because of the negative symbolism of their all black plumage and the eating of carrion 101  in sweden ravens are known as the ghosts of murdered people and in germany as the souls of the damned in danish folklore valravne that ate a kings heart gained human knowledge could perform great malicious acts could lead people astray had superhuman powers and were terrible animals 102 as in traditional mythology and folklore the common raven features frequently in more modern writings such as the works of william shakespeare and perhaps most famously in the poem the raven by edgar allan poe ravens have appeared in the works of charles dickens 103  j r r tolkien 104  stephen king 105  george r r martin 106  and joan aiken 107  108  109  110  among othersit continues to be used as a symbol in areas where it once had mythological status as the national bird of bhutan 111  kings of bhutan wear the raven crown official bird of the yukon territory 112  and on the coat of arms of the isle of man once a viking colony 113 in persia and arabia the raven was held as a bird of bad omen but a 14th century arabic work reports use of the raven in falconry 114 the modern unisex given name raven is derived from the english word raven as a masculine name raven parallels the old norse hrafn 115  and old english hræfn which were both bynames and personal names 116 mythology edit in tlingit and haida cultures raven was both a trickster and creator god related beliefs are widespread among the peoples of siberia and northeast asia 117  the kamchatka peninsula for example was supposed to have been created by the raven god kutkh 118  there are several references to common ravens in the old testament of the bible and it is an aspect of mahakala in bhutanese mythology 111 in norse mythology huginn from the old norse for thought and muninn old norse for memory or mind are a pair of ravens that fly all over the world midgard and bring the god odin information additionally among the norse raven banner standards were carried by such figures as the jarls of orkney 119  king cnut the great of england norway and denmark 120  and harald hardrada 121  in the british isles ravens also were symbolic to the celts in irish mythology the goddess morrígan alighted on the hero cú chulainns shoulder in the form of a raven after his death 122  in welsh mythology they were associated with the welsh god bran the blessed whose name translates to raven according to the mabinogion brans head was buried in the white hill of london as a talisman against invasion 123 a legend developed that england would not fall to a foreign invader so long as there were ravens at the tower of london although this is often thought to be an ancient belief the official tower of london historian geoff parnell believes that this is actually a romantic victorian invention 124  125 in the jewish christian and islamic traditions the raven was the first animal to be released from noahs ark so it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made then he sent out a raven which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth he also sent out from himself a dove to see if the waters had receded from the face of the ground 126  the raven is mentioned a dozen times in the bible in the new testament jesus tells a parable using the raven to show how people should rely on god for their needs and not riches luke 1224 127  the raven is also mentioned in quran at the story of cain and abel adams firstborn son cain kills his brother abel but he doesnt know what to do with the corpse then allah sent a raven scratching up the ground to show him how to hide his brothers naked corpse he said woe unto me am i not able to be as this raven and so hide my brothers naked corpse and he became repentant 128 references edit  birdlife international 2012 corvus corax iucn red list of threatened species version 20132 international union for conservation of nature retrieved 26 november

american redstart   wikipedia the american redstart setophaga ruticilla is a new world warbler it is unrelated to the old world redstartsetymology edit the genus name setophaga is from ancient greek ses moth and phagos eating and the specific ruticilla is new latin for redstart from latin rutilus red and new latin cilla tail 2  redstart refres to the males red tail start being an old word for tail 3 description edit the american redstart is a smallish warbler it measures 11 to 14 cm 43 to 55 in in total length and has a wingspan of 16 to 23 cm 63 to 91 in its length is boosted by a relatively long tail and it is one of the lightest birds in its family 4  weight is considerably less in winter than in summer males weigh an average of 86 g 030 oz in summer but drop to 72 g 025 oz in winter while females drop even more from an average of 87 g 031 oz to an average of 69 g 024 oz 5  6  among standard measurements the wing chord is 55 to 69 cm 22 to 27 in the tail is 49 to 58 cm 19 to 23 in the bill is 07 to 09 cm 028 to 035 in and the tarsus is 15 to 19 cm 059 to 075 in 7  the breeding males are unmistakable jet black above apart from large orange red patches on their wings and tails their breast sides are also orange with the rest of their underparts colored white in their other plumages american redstarts display green in their upperparts along with black central tails and grey heads the orange patches of the breeding males are replaced by yellow in the plumages of the females and young birds orange and yellow coloration is due to the presence of carotenoids males possess the red carotenoid canthaxanthin and the yellow carotenoids canary xanthophyll a and b all of which mix together to produce an orange color while the females possess only the yellow carotenoids recent research indicates that an age and sex effect on observed color attributes of hue brightness and saturation exists in american redstarts with the exception for saturation which only showed an age effect 8  their song is a series of musical see notes their call is a soft chipdistribution and habitat edit although perhaps not as common as in the past this appears to be one of the most stable and abundant species of new world warbler its numbers exceeded in total by the common yellowthroat yellow warbler and yellow rumped warbler because of much wider natural breeding ranges in those species and perhaps exceeding those in sheer density within appropriate range 9  10  11  they breed in north america across southern canada and the eastern united states these birds are migratory wintering in central america the west indies and northern south america in venezuela they are called candelitas they are very rare vagrants to western europe during the breeding season this warbler inhabits open canopy mostly deciduous forests second growth and forest edge across much of the united states and southern canada this insectivorous bird often shares its foraging habitats with other warblers and is found feeding in the mid to lower regions of a tree or shrub a wide range of habitats are occupied during migration including many shrubby areas on their wintering grounds in central and south america this warbler may be found in nearly all woody habitats but tend to avoid non forested agricultural areas it is often found in shade grown coffee plantations which provide native trees and shrubs as well as coffee trees elevations occupied vary by location as this species may be found at elevations up to 3000 m 9800 ft in south america but only up to 1500 m 4900 ft in jamaicabehaviour edit breeding edit the breeding habitats of the redstarts are open woodlands or scrub often located near water they nest in the lower part of a bush laying 2–5 eggs in a neat cup shaped nest the clutch is incubated by the female for 10 to 13 days the young fledge after 9 days in the nest and may remain with one parent for up to 3 weeks after fledging first year males are able to reproduce during their first breeding season but they retain the female like plumage which may contribute to low reproductive success less than 50 of first year males until year 2 in contrast most first year females successfully reproduce during their first breeding season there is evidence for a skewed sex ratio that results in a surplus of unmated males 12  13 american redstarts display a mixed mating strategy they are predominantly monogamous but around 25 of males maintain multiple territories and are polygynous even within monogamous pairs a high proportion of offspring—as many as 40—are not fathered by the male of the pair the intensity of the males coloration which is due to carotenoid pigments predicts their success at holding territory in their non breeding winter locations in the caribbean the probability that they will be polygynous and the proportion of offspring in their nests that they will themselves father 14  males are invariably very territorial and the superior males occupy the best habitats such as moist mangroves while inferior males occupy secondary habitats such as dry scrub forestsfeeding edit the redstarts feed almost exclusive on insects which are usually caught by flycatching american redstarts also have been known to catch their insect prey by gleaning it from leaves this is a very active species the tail is often held partly fanned out these birds have been observed flashing the orange and yellow of their tails on and off to startle and chase insects from the underbrush overall this species is a very flexible opportunistic feeder that can easily adapt to varying habitat season insect community vegetation structure and time of day the diet consists largely of caterpillars moths flies leafhoppers and planthoppers small wasps beetles aphids stoneflies and spiders few berries and seeds are consumed but are most often from barberry serviceberry and magnolia 13 mortality edit the oldest known redstart to be banded was over 10 years of age other adults have been known to live up to around 5 years of age however few survive past the first stages of life setophaga ruticilla is vulnerable to both terrestrial and aerial predators highest rates of predation occur during the breeding season when eggs and helpless nestlings are abundant and easy prey for varied predators females mostly brood during this period and thus often fall prey to nest predators common terrestrial predators include red squirrels fishers eastern chipmunks american black bears flying squirrels fox snakes and domestic cats aerial predators take nestlings eggs or even adults in flight possible aerial predators include jaegers blue jays common ravens northern saw whet owls common grackles northern goshawks and sharp shinned hawks and coopers hawks 13  15 conservation edit successful conservation efforts of the redstart like any other migrating bird include protecting and providing habitat throughout its entire range the benefits to coffee farms that redstarts and other coffee birds provide have encouraged coffee farmers to adapt shade trees and adjacent forest patches in their farming practices as additional habitat for the birds 16  while shade tree coffee farms offer a somewhat practical compromise between habitat preservation and agriculture there is still not enough data to back the notion that practices like shade tree coffee farms can replace the natural habitat that was once there 17  still the most effective method for american redstart conservation would be natural habitat preservation at wintering and breeding

roadrunner   wikipedia the roadrunner genus geococcyx also known as a chaparral bird or chaparral cock is a fast running ground cuckoo that has a long tail and a crest it is found in the southwestern united states and mexico 1  2  usually in the desert some have been clocked at 20 miles per hour 32 kmhspecies edit the subfamily neomorphinae the new world ground cuckoos includes eleven species of birds 3  while the genus geococcyx has just two 4  the greater roadrunner and the lesser roadrunner the greater roadrunner g californianus inhabits mexico and the southwestern united states the lesser roadrunner g velox inhabits mexico and central america 5  6 morphology edit the roadrunner generally ranges in size from 22 to 24 in 56 to 61 cm from tail to beak the average weight is about 8–15 oz 230–430 g 7  the roadrunner is a large slender black brown and white streaked ground bird with a distinctive head crest it has long legs strong feet and an oversized dark bill the tail is broad with white tips on the three outer tail feathers the bird has a bare patch of skin behind each eye this patch is shaded blue anterior to red posterior the lesser roadrunner is slightly smaller not as streaky and has a smaller bill both the lesser roadrunner and the greater roadrunner leave behind very distinct x track marks appearing as if they are travelling in both directionsroadrunners and other members of the cuckoo family have zygodactyl feet the roadrunner can run at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour 32 kmh 8  and generally prefer sprinting to flying though it will fly to escape predators during flight the short rounded wings reveal a white crescent in the primary feathersvocalization edit the roadrunner has a slow and descending dove like coo it also makes a rapid vocalized clattering sound with its beak citation needed notorious for its well recognised meep meep call when in flightgeographic range edit roadrunners inhabit the deserts of the southwestern united states mexico and central america they live in arid lowland or mountainous shrubland widely dispersed in dry open country with scattered brush they are non migratory staying in their breeding area year round 9  the greater roadrunner is not currently considered threatened in the us but is habitat limited 10 food and foraging habits edit the roadrunner is an opportunistic omnivore its diet normally consists of insects such as grasshoppers crickets caterpillars and beetles small reptiles such as lizards collared lizards and snakes including rattlesnakes 11  rodents and small mammals spiders including tarantulas scorpions centipedes snails small birds and nestlings eggs and fruits and seeds like those from prickly pear cactuses and sumacs the lesser roadrunner eats mainly insects the roadrunner forages on the ground and when hunting usually runs after prey from under cover it may leap to catch insects and commonly batters certain prey against the ground because of its quickness the roadrunner is one of the few animals that preys upon rattlesnakes 12  it is also the only real predator of tarantula hawk wasps 9 behavior and breeding edit the roadrunner usually lives alone or in pairs breeding pairs are monogamous and mate for life 13  and pairs may hold a territory all year during the courtship display the male bows alternately lifting and dropping his wings and spreading his tail he parades in front of the female with his head high and his tail and wings drooped and may bring an offering of food the reproductive season is spring to mid summer depending on geographic location and species 9 the roadrunners nest is often composed of sticks and may sometimes contain leaves feathers snakeskins or dung 14  it is commonly placed 1–3 meters above ground level 15  in a low tree bush or cactus roadrunner eggs are generally white the greater roadrunner generally lays 2–6 eggs per clutch but the lesser roadrunners clutches are typically smaller hatching is asynchronous both sexes incubate the nest with males incubating the nest at night and feed the hatchlings for the first one to two weeks after the young hatch one parent remains at the nest the young leave the nest at two to three weeks old foraging with parents for a few days after 9 greater roadrunners often become habituated to the presence of peoplethermoregulation edit during the cold desert night the roadrunner lowers its body temperature slightly going into a slight torpor to conserve energy to warm itself during the day the roadrunner exposes dark patches of skin on its back to the sun 9 greater roadrunner warming itself in the sun exposing the dark skin and feathers on its backin popular culture edit the roadrunner appears as the primary protagonist in wile e coyote and the road runner cartoon by the warner brothers as part of the looney tunes series the bird in the programme is based on the greater roadrunner 16 a series of professional hockey teams in arizona have been named after the bird the most recent being the tucson roadrunners of the american hockey leaguethe mascot of the university of texas at san antonio is a roadrunnerreferences edit alsop iii fred j 2002 birds of

loggerhead shrike   wikipedia the loggerhead shrike lanius ludovicianus is a passerine bird it is the only member of the shrike family endemic to north america the related northern shrike l excubitor occurs north of its range but also in the palearctic it is nicknamed the butcherbird after its carnivorous tendencies as it consumes prey such as amphibians insects lizards small mammals and small birds 2  due to its small size and weak talons this predatory bird relies on impaling its prey upon thorns or barbed wire for facilitated consumption 3  the numbers of loggerhead shrike have significantly decreased in recent years especially in midwest new england and mid atlantic areas 4 description edit the loggerhead shrike is a medium sized passerine 5  loggerhead refers to the relatively large size of the head as compared to the rest of the body it measures approximately 9 inches from bill to tail the wing and tail length is about 382 and 387 inches long respectively 5  it weighs on average 50 grams with a range of 45 60 grams for a healthy adult shrike 6  the adult plumage of the loggerhead shrike is grey above with a white to pale grey breast and black tarsi and feet the bird possesses a black mask that extends across the eyes to its bill unlike that of the similar but slightly larger northern shrike the wings are black with a distinct white patch on the primaries the tail is black edged with white and the irises are brown 7  the beak is short black and hooked and contains a tomial tooth to help tear into prey 8  it is difficult to sex an adult loggerhead shrike in the field as they are sexually monochromatic 9  however several studies have reported sexual dimorphism in plumage and size traits 8  9  10  juveniles possess a paler gray plumage that is subtly vermiculated 11 taxonomy edit there are eleven recognized subspecies of loggerhead shrike 12 lanius ludovicianus anthonyi island loggerhead shrike on santa rosa santa cruz and santa catalina

chord to tail length ratio was an important indicator for distinguishing between subspecies 8  lanius ludovicianus migrans found in eastern north america can be distinguished from the western subspecies l l excubitorides by wing length tail length and colour l l migrans have a paler forehead than the top of the head 7  according to mundy et al’s 1997 study there is a substantial genetic difference between the island subspecies l l mearnsi and the mainland subspecies l l gambeli due to a gene flow barrier between the two species 13 distribution and habitat edit loggerhead shrikes were once widely distributed across southern canada the contiguous usa and mexico 8  however their populations have heavily declined since the 1960s 10  four subspecies reside in southern coastal california mearnsi gambeli grinnelli and anthonyi 14  l l mearnsi is only found on san clemente island in california whereas l l gambeli breeds on the mainland and l l anthonyi breeds on the channel islands 13  l l excubitorides is found in central north america whereas the non migrating l l ludovicianus resides in southeastern north america 10  the distribution of l l migrans ranges from north to eastern north america however its range has been diminishing since the 1940s 7 the bird requires an open habitat with an area to forage elevated perches and nesting sites 15  they are often found in open pastures or grasslands and appears to prefer red cedar and hawthorn trees for nesting 16  the hawthorn’s thorns and the cedar’s pin like needles protect and conceal the shrike from predators 17  it may also nest in fence rows or hedge rows near open pastures and requires elevated perches as lookout points for hunting 15  16  open pastures and grasslands with shorter vegetation are preferred by loggerhead shrikes as it increases their hunting efficiency longer vegetation often requires more time and energy to be spent searching for prey so these birds gravitate towards areas of shorter vegetation 18 behavior edit although loggerhead shrikes are passerines they are a predatory species that hunt during the day they primarily eat insects but also consume arachnids reptiles amphibians rodents bats 19  and small birds 20  the size of prey ranges from 0001 g insects to 25 g mice or reptiles 2 they are not true birds of prey as they lack the large strong talons used to catch and kill prey 3  instead they are sit and wait hunters that stalk prey by hawking and diving from elevated perches by scanning their vicinity from a perch instead of flying the shrike does not exhaust its energy during the search preferred perches are approximately 4 m off the ground and are usually outer branches of trees or telephone wires 2  21  in winter prey availability is low due to the shrike’s preference for insects and poikilothermic prey during this time shrikes may be energetically stressed and underweight 2  insects are consumed in mid flight but vertebrates usually require more handling time and therefore more energy 3  due to the shrike’s small size in proportion to the size of its prey it must rely on specialized adaptations to facilitate its hunting the powerful hooked beak of the loggerhead shrike allows it to sever the neck of a small vertebrate larger prey are subjected to impaling in which they are pushed down into a sharp projection such as a thorn or barbed wire the bird can then tear off flesh by using the projection as an anchor 3  the shrike may also use the thorn to fasten and store its food to return to at a later time 2 the motion of impalement appears to be instinctive as parent shrikes do not demonstrate the behavior to their nestlings however a young shrike must experience impaling prey upon an actual projection during a critical developmental period otherwise it will not learn to use the instinctive impaling action upon an actual projection 22  kleptoparasitism has also been observed in nature in which the shrike chased down another bird and stole its recently caught prey 23 reproduction edit loggerhead shrikes are monogamous birds and begin breeding during their first spring 7  during this time the male performs a courtship ritual that occurs in flight he dances erratically in the air flying rapidly up and down and occasionally chasing the female he presents himself to his potential mate by fanning out his tail and fluttering his wings 3  8  24  females may respond to the fluttering display with begging notes similar to those of juveniles begging for food this encourages the male to feed her 3 the bird breeds in semi open areas in southern ontario quebec and the canadian prairie provinces south to mexico it nests in dense trees and shrubs there is an increase in average clutch size as latitude increases shrikes begin incubation after laying the second to last egg resulting in asynchronous hatching incubation on average lasts 16 days the female lays 4 to 8 eggs in a bulky cup made of twigs and grass once hatched nestlings are fed by both the male and female parent average fledging period is about 19 days young may then remain nearby and dependent on adults for 3 to 4 weeks after that they begin to forage independently oftentimes nestlings do not survive long past hatching in the case of dead nestlings adult shrikes may eat or discard their bodies or else feed them to their remaining young 25  the oldest recorded age of a loggerhead shrike was 12 years and 6 months 26 vocalization edit their vocal range is broad and varied and has been described as harsh and jarring 27  the shrike’s notes include squeaky whistles shrill trills guttural warbles 5  the trills sung by males during breeding season vary in rhythm and pitch when alarmed a shrike will produce a “schgra a a” shriek while spreading out its tail feathers nestlings will make “tcheek” and “tsp” sounds shortly after hatching 28  during courtship feedings females may ask for food with “mak” begging notes conversely males emit “wuut” or “shack” sounds to offer food 29  the male emits a territorial harsh shriek while the female’s song is pitched lower and softer than the male’s generally the male is far more vocal than the female 7  28 conservation status edit loggerhead shrike populations have been decreasing in north america since the 1960s reasons behind the decline remain unclear although suggestions include habitat loss pesticide contamination climate change and human disturbance 10  the eastern loggerhead shrike ll migrans is critically endangered in canada with fewer than 35 known breeding pairs in canada 30  the san clemente island shrike l l mearnsi is critically endangered with a population as low as 5 10 individuals during 1983 1988 13  although only this island subspecies is legally listed as endangered in the united states the species is declining continentwide and no longer occurs in most of the northeastern us 31  a captive population was established at the toronto zoo and mcgill university in 1997 in 2001 an experimental field breeding and release program managed by wildlife preservation canada was established field breeding refers to moving captive pairs from their wintering cages at the toronto zoo and mcgill to large enclosures within shrike habitat in ontario where the pairs nest and raise their young and then the young are released to the wild when theyd naturally disperse from their parents since 2004 over 90 young have been released annually and between 2 and 65 of young released have successfully migrated and returned to breed in the subsequent year 32   33 references edit  birdlife international 2012 lanius ludovicianus iucn red list of threatened species version 20132 international union for conservation of nature retrieved 26

great grey shrike   wikipedia the great grey shrike northern grey shrike or northern shrike lanius excubitor is a large songbird species in the shrike family laniidae it forms a superspecies with its parapatric southern relatives the southern grey shrike l meridionalis the chinese grey shrike l sphenocerus and the loggerhead shrike l ludovicianus within the great grey shrike species itself there are nine subspecies males and females are similar in plumage pearly grey above with a black eye mask and white underpartsbreeding takes place generally north of 50° northern latitude in northern europe and asia where it is known as the great grey shrike and in north america where it is known as the northern shrike north of 55° northern latitude in canada and alaska most populations migrate south in winter to temperate regions 2  the great grey shrike is carnivorous with rodents making up over half its diettaxonomy and systematics edit the scientific name of the great grey shrike literally means sentinel butcher lanius is the latin term for a butcher while excubitor is latin for a watchman or sentinel 3  this refers to the birds two most conspicuous behaviours – storing food animals by impaling them on thorns and using exposed tree tops or poles to watch the surrounding area for possible prey use of the former by conrad gessner established the quasi scientific term lanius for the shrikes linnaeus chose his specific name because the species observes approaching hawks and announces  the presence  of songbirds 4  as he put it this habit was also put to use in falconry as fancifully recorded by william yarrell later 5  the common english name shrike is from old english scríc shriek referring to the shrill call 6 the species was first scientifically described by carl linnaeus in his 1758 edition of systema naturae under the current scientific name his description is l anius  cauda cuneiformi lateribus alba dorso cano alis nigris macula alba – a shrike with a wedge shaped white bordered tail back grey wings black with white spot at that time none of the other grey shrikes – including the lesser grey shrike l minor for which the description of the tail pattern is incorrect and which some authors already recognized as distinct – were considered separate species by linnaeus but that was to change soonlinnaeus binomial name replaced the cumbersome and confusing descriptive names of the earlier naturalist books he gives as his sources in his own fauna svecica he named it ampelis caerulescens alis caudaque nigricantibus light blue waxwing wings and tail blackish while it is called pica cinerea sive lanius major ash grey magpie or greater shrike by johann leonhard frisch who in his splendid colour plate confused male and female but most authors cited by linnaeus – eleazar albin ulisse aldrovandi john ray and francis willughby – called it lanius cinereus major or similar which is a near literal equivalent of the common name great grey shrike the type locality of linnaeus is simply given as europa europe 7 vernacular names edit ulisse aldrovandi conrad gessner john ray and francis willughby also reported old folk names mainly from germanic languages wereangel or wierangel from the pennines of england where the bird was noted as a vagrant as well as warkangel werkengel or wurchangel in various german dialects eg around frankfurtmain and strasbourg probably mean choking angel cf standard german würgeengel these names are unlikely to significantly pre date the times of saint boniface c 700 ad because of their christian connotation the related werkenvogel choking bird might however do so the english version having become wariangle or weirangle was eventually transferred to the native red backed shrike l collurio and lingered on into modern times in yorkshire along the upper rhine between strasbourg and heidelberg for example linkenom is attested its origin is unclear low german neghen doer and middle german nünmörder were also used this has today evolved into neuntöter and specifically means the red backed shrike but could in earlier times refer to any native lanius it literally means killer of nine  prey animals  and refers to the food cachesa falconers name for the great grey shrike was mattagesse which is related to matagasse from the western alps these terms may mean magpie killer due to their use for luring carnivorous birds to hunters – but perhaps more likely killer magpie considering that the bird was believed to be a peculiar sort of magpie by johann leonhard frisch and others and that another vernacular english name was murdering pie shrike meanwhile is of germanic origin also and dates back at least to middle or early modern english schricum this is related to such words as norwegian and swedish skrika shriek skrike german schrei scream or icelandic shrikja shrieker but it seems to have become the dominant term only in rather recent times for as late as the 18th century the species was still widely known as greater butcher bird in english just like it was known as the boucher butcher in the french jura a whimsical name – presumably from scotland or nearby england – was white wisky john in reference to its wavy and somewhat unelegant flight during which its large areas of light plumage are conspicuous 8 relationships and evolution edit the shrike family laniidae is a member of the corvoidea the most ancient of the four large songbird superfamilies among its superfamily the closest relatives of the laniidae are probably the corvidae crows and allies little reliable data exists on its evolution certainly even though the supposed ancestral shrike lanius miocaenus might not belong in the laniidae and probably does not belong in the same genus as l excubitor the genus dates back to miocene times a lanius fossil from the late miocene turolian age c 6 million years ago has been found at polgárdi hungary its relationship to the modern species is unclear however all things considered the grey shrike lineage probably represents the holarctic sister to the african radiation of fiscal shrikes these two seem to have originated in a west  or southwestward expansion from the genus origin which considering the biogeography of living lanius lineages was probably somewhere between asia minor and central asia at the time of the polgárdi fossil it is rather likely that the grey shrikes were a distinct lineage already given that they and the fiscals generally follow bergmanns rule the smallish fossil makes an unlikely ancestor to the large grey shrikes even when taking into account the somewhat warmer miocene climate 9 the grey shrike superspecies consists of l excubitor and its parapatric southern relatives as mentioned above the other members of this group are the southern grey shrike l meridionalis the chinese grey shrike l sphenocerus and the loggerhead shrike l ludovicianus the centre of this groups radiation is probably in the eastern mediterranean region and the southern grey shrike represents the basalmost form the other three only diverged during the expansion into temperate regions this must have happened fairly recently because lineage sorting is not complete in the grey shrikes and most of the present day habitat of l excubitor was uninhabitable during much of the quaternary glaciation because of the phylogenetic uncertainties surrounding this close knit group in the absence of a good fossil record some refrain from splitting them up into distinct species most modern authors do so however 1  10 subspecies edit l e melanopterus wintering in polandwithin the great grey shrike species nine subspecies can be recognized they can be divided into three groups occurring in western eurasia eastern eurasia and north america respectively 11 west eurasian groupmedium grey above pale grey hue below some white on primaries and sometimes secondarieslighter grey than excubitor above dull white below more white on primaries and secondarieslanius excubitor leucopterus – south western russia along border to kazakhstan to south western siberialight grey above white below considerable white on primaries and secondarieseast eurasian grouplanius excubitor sibiricus – eastern siberia to northern mongoliabrowner above than excubitor distinct but delicate banding below some white on primary bases onlysmaller and paler than sibiricus banding below pale and indistinct some white on primary bases onlybrowner than sibiricus above banding below well developed little white on primary baseslanius excubitor funereus – tian shan and western chinalarge quite dark and brownish below bluish grey with almost black banding little white on primary basesnorth american groupsimilar to excubitor but darker with faint barring below john james audubon called this subspecies the great american shrike in his book birds of americalarger and paler than borealis paralleling homeyeri compared to excubitordescription edit an adult great grey shrike is a medium sized passerine about as large as a big thrush measuring from 22 to 26 cm 87 to 102 in long it typically weighs around 60 to 70 g 21 to 25 oz although some subspecies are noticeably smaller or larger and even in the nominate subspecies adult weights between 48 and 81 g 17 and 29 oz are recorded the wings are around 114 cm 45 in and the tail around 109 cm 43 in long in the nominate subspecies its bill measures about 23 mm 091 in from tip to skull and the tarsometatarsus part of its legs actually feet is around 274 mm 108 in long 12  wingspan can range from 30 to 36 cm 12 to 14 in 13 adult male top and female l e excubitor with fledging young bottomthe general colour of the upperparts is pearl grey tinged brownish towards the east of its eurasian range the cheeks and chin as well as a thin and often hard to see stripe above the eye are white and a deep black mask extends from the beak through the eye to the ear coverts the area immediately above the beak is grey the scapulars shoulder feathers are white and the wings are black with a white bar made up by the bases of the primary remiges continuing slightly offset onto the bases of the secondary remiges in some regions the tail is black long and pointed at the tip the outer rectrices have white outer vanes the underparts are white slightly tinged with grey in most subspecies in particular the breast is usually darker and sometimes browner than the rest of the light underside and may appear as an indistinct band between the lighter belly and white throat in the subspecies around the north pacific in particular and in females elsewhere too there may be faint brownish bars on the breast the bill is large and hooked at the tip and coloured nearly black but pale at the base of the under mandible though the extent varies seasonally the legs and feet are blackish 14 males and females are about the same size and do not differ conspicuously in appearance except by direct comparison in the female the underparts are greyer and are usually visibly barred greyish brown and the white wing and tail markings are characteristically less in extent though this is rarely clearly visible except in flight fledged young birds are heavily tinged greyish brown all over with barring on the upperside and indistinct buffy white markings the tips of the tertiary remiges and the wing coverts are also buffy with a black band in the latter in the north american subspecies borealis the fledglings are tinged quite brown indeed on upperside and wings and have sharp and dark underside bars in eurasia fledglings moult into a female like plumage with the tertiary bars usually remaining in autumn across its range the young acquire the adult plumage in their first spring 15 vocalizations edit the males song consists of short pleasant warbling strophes interspersed with fluid whistles the individual phrases may go like tu tu krr pree pree or trr turit trr turit to announce that it has become aware of someone straying into its territory – be it a female or male of its species or a large mammal – it gives long shrill raspy whistles like trriiu or tkwiiet to announce to females it often mixes these whistles with a strophe of song a softer whistle goes like trüüt these whistles are also used in duets between mates in winter and neighbours in the breeding season various contact calls have been described as chliep gihrrr kwä or wuut these are frequently heard during courtship interspersed with song phrases as the harsh whistles are in pre courtship the song becomes softer and more warbling as the male shows the female around his territory and at potential nest sites the male gives a lively chatter containing fluting tli tli prrr trills and kwiwpüh calls 16 when disturbed its alarm note is a harsh jay like kweee greee or jaaa often repeated twice the more excited the birds become the higher and faster the calls get via chek chek chek to a rattle trr trr trr or an explosive aak aak aak a bird of prey alert is given with a whistle breezeek knuk calls are given by adults confronted with a potential threat to their young to beg for food – young to adults or pairmembers to each other – rows of waik calls are given this species sometimes tries to attract small songbirds by mimicking their calls so it may attempt to catch them for food 17 similar species edit the southern grey shrike l meridionalis was formerly included in the great grey shrike as subspecies it occurs in south western europe iberian peninsula and france southwards to africa around the sahara and also in central asia it prefers different habitat – lightly wooded grassland in the great more arid shrubland in the southern grey shrike – and where the species ranges overlap they do not hybridize at present though they may have done so in past millennia 18 elsewhere the southern parapatric relatives of the l excubitor are the chinese grey shrike l sphenocerus from east asia and the loggerhead shrike l ludovicianus from north america the northern grey shrike is sympatric in winter quarters with each of its three close relatives at the north of their range their overall colouration is – apparently plesiomorphically – shared in sub saharan africa by the somewhat more distantly related grey backed fiscal l excubitoroides which is found from the sahel eastwards and mackinnons fiscal l mackinnoni of the congo basin region the lesser grey shrike l minor balkans to central asia seems to be quite distinct indeed and is sympatric with the grey shrike superspecies between eastern europe and central asia it may be more closely related to the small brown shrikes and resemble the bold aggressive and hard to catch grey shrikes because of batesian mimicry 19 the southern grey shrike is clearer and usually darker grey above and not tinged grey but often decidedly pinkish on the belly and particular breast the white eyebrow extends to over the beak which has typically a larger pale base the barring pattern is less developed at all ages hardly ever present even in females and slighter in the otherwise very similar fledglings 20 east asian l excubitor are barely sympatric with the chinese grey shrike the latter is larger and generally differs from the northern species as the southern does and in addition has much larger white areas in wings and tail 21 the loggerhead shrike is hard to distinguish but the proportion of the head to the beak which seems stubby in l ludovicianus by comparison and is all dark is usually reliable indeed the word loggerhead refers to the relatively larger head of the southern species 22 the lesser grey shrike is a smaller and comparatively short tailed bird it can best be recognized by the rather large black area above the bill almost reaching to the forehead and without a white stripe above it in flight the wide instead of pointed black tail end of l minor is characteristic the african species are completely allopatric with l excubitor they lack white scapulars grey backed fiscal or wingspots mackinnons fiscal and differ in some other details particularly the tail pattern 23 distribution and habitat edit the great grey shrike occurs throughout most temperate and subarctic regions of the northern hemisphere generally its breeding range is limited to areas north of 50° northern latitude in eurasia and north of 55° northern latitude in north america in the high mountains of the altai tian shan region it ranges south perhaps as far as 42° northern latitude its northern limit is generally 70° northern latitude except in eastern canada quebec where it only reaches up to about 60° northern latitude it is only found as a vagrant in iceland the british isles the mediterranean region excluding the iberian peninsula and perhaps romania but including cyprus and korea there do not appear to be breeding records from the entire kamchatka peninsula in switzerland the present day czech republic and southern germany small populations were found in the mid 20th century but have declined or even disappeared since then 24 except for the subspecies bianchii which is largely all year resident and subspecies excubitor in the temperate european parts of its range with their mild maritime climate the species is a short distance migrant the migrations are triggered by scarcity of food and therefore according to prey population levels the winter range might little extend south beyond the breeding range or be entirely parapatric to it the populations of the central asian mountains mostly migrate downslope rather than southwards females are more prone to migration than males they do not appear to migrate on average longer or shorter distances than males and consequently are the dominant sex in many parts of the winter range birds leave for winter quarters a more or less short time after breeding – july to october with most birds staying to september – and return to nest mainly in marchapril but some only arrive in may in recent decades the number of birds remaining on the breeding grounds all year has been noted to increase eg in fennoscandia whereas for example borealis seems to be as rare a winter visitor in northern ohio as it was a century ago 2  25  26 the preferred habitat is generally open grassland perhaps with shrubs interspersed and adjacent lookout points these are normally trees – at forest edges in much of the habitat but single trees or small stands at the taiga tundra border in steppe it will utilize any isolated perch be it fence posts power lines or rocks in general some 5–15 perching sites per hectare habitat seem to be required it avoids low grassland with no lookouts and nesting opportunities trees or large shrubs as well as dense forest with no hunting ground apart from grassland the birds will utilize a variety of hunting habitats including bogs clearings or non industrially farmed fields breeding birds appear to have different microhabitat desires but little detail is known yet 27 behaviour edit perching sites are important features of great grey shrike habitatthis species is territorial but likes to breed in dispersed groups of a good half dozen adults it is not known to what extent the birds in such groups are related in the temperate parts of its range groups are perhaps 5 km 31 mi apart while individual territories within each group may be as small as 20 ha 49 acres but more typically are about twice that size in less hospitable climes territories may be more than 350 ha 14 sq mi throughout the breeding season in prime habitat territories are held by mated pairs and single males looking for a partner in less productive habitat floaters hold territories more ephemerally this leads to shifts in population density between regions as floaters move between groups of territorial birds in search of a bountiful unclaimed territory to settle down andor a partner to mate with on the wintering grounds pairs separate to account for the lower amount of food available at that time but if both members migrate they tend to have their wintering grounds not far apart as it seems once an individual great grey shrike has found a wintering territory it likes it will return there subsequently and perhaps even try to defend it against competitors just like a summer territory throughout the year the birds regularly but briefly move through a range up to three times larger than their territory this is tolerated by territory owners in winter more easily than in summer and the parts of europe where all year residents and winter visitors co occur typically have population densities around eight verification needed  birdskm2 about thirty verification needed  per square mile and occasionally more in winter 28  before and after the nesting season groups of breeding birds will sometimes initiate gatherings these seem to occur at the boundary of the groups combined range or in the unclaimed land separating it from neighbouring groups the initiation signal is a conspicuous display flight given by a bird surveying its territory it spirals tens of metersyards high into the air usually briefly does a fluttering hover at the top of the spiral and then glides down group neighbours will respond by performing the same type of flight and eventually about half the groups members will depart to the meeting location where they will spend several tens of minutes – sometimes more than an hour – chattering calling duetting and excitedly moving about the meeting site which typically is some small tree or shrubbery in winter birds will often assemble in small groups and roost together particularly to keep warm during the night this is apparently not initiated with a specific assembly display however 29 the flight of the great grey shrike is undulating and rather heavy but its dash is straight and determined it is as noted above also capable of hovering flights which last briefly but may be repeated time after time because of the birds considerable stamina it will usually stay low above the ground in flight approaching perches from below and landing in an upward swoop in social interactions birds signal an aggressive stance by a bold upright posture fanning and then flicking the tail and eventually the wings also as the bird gets more excited it signals its readiness to strike at an intruder by shifting to a horizontal pose and fluffing its feathers raising them into a small crest along the top of the head birds appease conspecifics by head turns away from them if close by or by imitating the crouching fluttering pose and calls given by fledglings begging for food if sitting father apart the submission gesture to prevent an imminent attack by a conspecific is pointing the beak straight up 30 north american fledglings apparently have one moult in their first spring only in which they acquire adult plumage eurasian ones moult part of their juvenile plumage before their first winter and the rest in spring adults moult on their breeding grounds before going on migration or before the depth of winter if they are resident sometimes adults also seem to moult some feathers before attempting to breed as moult requires a considerable investment of energy some significant evolutionary benefits to offset this are likely reducing feather wear and parasite load moulting can make a bird more physically attractive and healthy and may thus increase its chance of successful reproduction the phenomenon is not well understood however 2 food and feeding edit occasionally animals as large as a young stoat mustela erminea are killed and eaten by great grey shrikesthe great grey shrike eats small vertebrates and large invertebrates to hunt this bird perches on the topmost branch of a tree telegraph pole or similar elevated spot in a characteristic upright stance some metersyards at least one and up to 18 m20 yd above ground alternatively it may scan the grassland below from flight essentially staying in one place during prolonged bouts of mainly hovering flight that may last up to 20 minutes it will drop down in a light glide for terrestrial prey or swoop hawk like on a flying insect small birds are sometimes caught in flight too usually by approaching them from below and behind and seizing their feet with the beak if no prey ventures out in the open great grey shrikes will rummage through the undergrowth or sit near hiding places and flash their white wing and tail markings to scare small animals into coming out as noted above it will sometimes mimic songbirds to entice them to come within striking distance 29 typically at least half the prey biomass is made up from small rodents from the cricetidae voles american mice and sometimes lemmings and murinae eurasian mice and sometimes young eurasian rats shrews songbirds lizards and frogs and toads typically as tadpoles make up most of the remaining vertebrate prey birds are generally of little importance however except in spring when male songbirds are engaged in courtship display and often rather oblivious of their surroundings in late summer when inexperienced fledglings abound and in winter when most small mammals hibernate occasionally bats newts and salamanders and even fish are eaten prey animals may exceptionally be almost as large as the birds themselves for example chicks of the willow ptarmigan lagopus lagopus or a young stoat large arthropods are the second most important prey by quantity though not by biomass in the latter respect they are only a bit more important than birds except as food for nestlings where they usually form a substantial part of the diet most important among invertebrate prey are insects especially beetles crickets and grasshoppers and bumblebees and wasps invertebrate prey of minor importance are spiders and scorpions crayfish and isopods snails and oligochaete worms carrion and berries are rarely if ever eaten though it might occasionally plunder songbird nests this is not well documented and it is not known to eat eggs 28  31 prey is killed by hitting it with the hooked beak aiming for the skull in vertebrates if too large to swallow in one or a few chunks it is transported to a feeding site by carrying it in the beak or if too large in the feet the feet are not suited for tearing up prey however it is rather impaled upon a sharp point – thorns or the barbs of barbed wire – or wedged firmly between forking branches thus secured the food can be ripped into bite sized pieces with the beak orthoptera that the birds have recognized as containing noxious chemicals are left impaled in the larder for several days until the chemicals that usually deter predators have been degraded great grey shrikes have also been observed to impale common toads bufo bufo and skin them – by ripping open the back skin and pulling it over the head – to avoid contamination of the meat by the toxic skin secretions large bones and similar inedible parts of prey animals are usually not ingested but smaller ones such as tiny bones or the elytra of beetles are eaten and later regurgitated as pellets 29  31 the basic metabolic rate of the great grey shrike is around 800 milliwatts or somewhat more than 11 milliwatts per gram of body mass an adult of this species needs about 50 g 18 oz of prey a day probably somewhat more in winter under most circumstances this would thus translate to one or two rodents one or two additional vertebrate prey animals including rodents and up to a single vertebrate prey items worth of invertebrates surplus food may be impaled for storage these larders are typically around 1 m 33 ft above ground and can be found anywhere within the birds territory but tend to be rather in the general vicinity of nest sites than far away from them 29  32 breeding and life history edit great grey shrikes breed during the summer typically once per year in exceptionally good conditions they raise two broods a year and if the first clutch is destroyed before hatching they are usually able to produce a second one their monogamous pair bond is strong during the breeding season and loosens over winter birds often choose a different mate than the year before to seek out potential mates males will venture outside their breeding territories if a female thus encountered finds a male to her liking she will visit to see whether they get along well and inspect the nesting sites he can offer the courtship period is generally longer than in the southern grey shrike l meridionalis usually starting about march and lasting to aprilmay at first the female rebuffs the male only allowing him to feed her males give increasingly vocal displays and show off the white markings of the wings in flight and of the tail by fanning it and turning away from the female he also occasionally turns to sit at a right angle to her eventually the female will join in the males displays and the songs will become duets to feed females and to show off their hunting prowess males will make their food caches in conspicuous places during this time when presenting nesting sites males give the variety of calls described above and jerk their head and fanned tail 33 nesting fieldfares turdus pilaris and great grey shrikes apparently cooperate to protect their offspring from predatorscopulation is typically initiated by the male bringing an attractive prey item to the female with both giving begging calls they approach until they are side by side the male then raises and swings his body left and right a few times and passes the prey to the female followed by the actual copulation the gatherings of neighbour groups see above cease when nesting is underway and when the eggs are nearly ready to lay the male guards his partner closely perching higher than her to watch for threats and frequently feeding her this apparently ensures her physical well being rather than preventing extra pair copulations as neighbouring males will stray through each others territory to snatch a quick fling with the resident females in this they have almost a one in three chance of success and consequently the average grey shrike nest is very likely to contain offspring of more than one male females may deposit their eggs in neighbours nests but this seems to occur more rarely in general mated females are fairly reclusive after their eggs have started developing a full clutch of eggs can be produced by a female in about 10–15 days 33 nests are built in april or may more than 1 m 33 ft above ground in trees this height varies according to habitat but while nests have been found almost 40 m 44 yd up most are 2–16 m above ground presence of mistletoes or vines like common ivy hedera helix on side branches near the trunk where nests are preferentially built will make a tree markedly more attractive fieldfares turdus pilaris nesting in the vicinity will also increase the desirability of nest sites to great grey shrikes which moreover often refuse to prey upon these thrushes nestlings though the opportunity is there apparently the two species are more efficient in spotting potential nest predators – in particular corvids – early on and mobbing them off cooperatively than either is on its own otherwise there is no clear preference for particular taxa of nesting trees provided they are sufficiently dense conifers seem to have become more popular with european l excubitor in recent decades but a diversity of deciduous trees is used just as well far more rarely large and especially thorny shrubs are used for nesting the actual nesting site is chosen by the male the courtship visits of the female are mainly to form and strengthen the pair bond also though the partners build the nest together the male collects most of the nesting material the cup nest is quite sizable measuring 20–28 cm 79–110 in in outer diameter its body is constructed of coarse vegetable material – mainly large twigs and chunks of moss though bits of fabric and rubbish may be added the interior cup is 8–12 cm 31–47 in in diameter and 10–15 cm 39–59 in deep it is lined with fine twigs and roots lichen hair and feathers building a nest from scratch takes a pair one to two weeks but if nests of the previous year in good locations remain usable they are repaired rather than discarded 34 laying usually takes place in may the clutch numbers three to nine eggs typically around seven with north american clutches tending to be larger on average than european ones if a second clutch is produced in one breeding season it is smaller than the first one the eggs have a white background colour usually with a grey hue and sometimes with a blue one they are patterned with blotches of yellowish  to reddish brown and purplish grey often denser around the blunt end they measure around 26 mm 10 in in length and 195 mm 077 in in width incubation takes around 16 days but may be closer to three weeks for large clutches it is generally done only by the female while the male may briefly take over incubating his task during this time is to provide food the altricial nestlings hatch naked blind and pink skinned weighing c 4 g 014 oz their skin turns darker after a few days the inside of their beak is pink and they probably lack spots or other prominent marks the wattles at the corners of the mouth are yellow as in many passerines as the nestlings grow the female broods them and later on assists in providing food the young fledge after 2–3 weeks typically in late june or early july they become independent of their parents about 3–6 weeks later sometimes a parent will single out particular fledglings possibly the weakest ones and focus their care and feeding on these during this time other adults have occasionally been recorded assisting in feeding a pairs offspring it is not clear whether these helpers at the nest are offspring of previous years or unrelated non breeding floaters or breeding neighbours 32  34 common cuckoos cuculus canorus have been noted as regular brood parasites of l e excubitor in the past for reasons unknown this has ceased since the late 1970s or so it may well be that the cuckoos gens laying eggs similar to those of the great grey shrike has become extinct among predators of eggs and nestlings corvids corvidae – extremely close relatives of the shrikes laniidae as it happens 35  – are most significant 34 usually more than half of all nests manage to hatch at least one young and around three quarters of all eggs laid hatch suggesting that if eggs are lost before hatching it usually is the entire clutch half to three quarters of the hatched young successfully fledge under most circumstances they will become sexually mature in their first spring and often attempt to breed right away on average great grey shrikes get a chance at four breeding attempts during their life with most birds in the wild getting eaten by a bird of prey or carnivorous mammal or dying of other causes before the end of their fifth winter raptorial birds are the main threat to shrikes after fledging with regular predators including species as small as little owls which are close to the same size as the shrike 36  the maximum documented lifespan however is 12 years 32  37 conservation status edit as remarked above the great grey shrike has apparently become extinct as a breeding bird in switzerland and the czech republic overall its stocks seem to be declining in the european part of its range since the 1970s in north america the populations seem to have been stable by contrast except in the east the increase and decline seem to be reactions to changing land use with an increase as the number of agricultural workers declined after world war ii and land fell fallow declining again when land consolidation see eg flurbereinigung had seriously depleted the number of hedgerows and similar elevated growth formerly common amidst the agricultural landscape for such a predatory bird the indiscriminate use of pesticides which will accumulate in adult carnivores and inhibit breeding success around the 1960s probably had a detrimental influence on stocks too 27 altogether the great grey shrike is common and widespread and not considered a threatened species by the iucn though they still include l meridionalis in l excubitor wherever it occurs its numbers are usually many hundreds or even thousands per country its stronghold is the region around sweden where at least almost 20000 perhaps as many as 50000 were believed to live in the late 20th century however in some countries it is not robustly established in estonia only a few hundred are found with less than 200 in belgium and some more or less than 100 in latvia and lithuania respectively the few dozen in the netherlands and the 10 birds or so in denmark might disappear because of a few years of adverse circumstances by contrast in luxembourg plentiful high quality habitat is found though the number of great grey shrikes in this tiny country is necessarily limited the average population density there is 25 times as high as in lithuania 1  27  a b c birdlife international 2012 lanius excubitor iucn red list of threatened species version 20132 international union for conservation of nature retrieved

bairds sparrow   wikipedia bairds sparrow ammodramus bairdii is a species of north american birds in the family emberizidae of order passeriformes it is a migratory bird native the united states canada and mexicodescription edit the bairds sparrow can be identified as a small brown streaked sparrow their faces are a yellow brown color featuring subtle black markings these birds have a narrow band of brown streaks on their chests this species can be distinguished from others by its unique broad ochre central crown stripe juveniles exhibit similar coloration but often have more streaking adult size is comparable for both males and females no sexual dimorphism is exhibited adults are generally about 12 cm and weigh 17 21 g their wingspan is usually around 23 cm 2 they are larger than le contes sparrow and do not exhibit orange coloration on their faces they exhibit very similar coloration and patterning to henslows sparrow but do not have green coloration on their faces the savannah sparrow is more heavily streaked and has an extra white marking on its head 2 distribution and habitat edit the bairds sparrow migrates from its summer breeding habitat the tall grass prairies of north central united states and south central canada to spend winters in northern mexico and the southern tip of the united states near texas 2  due to this migratory behavior they may be spotted all across the midwest portion of the united states during migratory seasons but most frequently can be found in north dakota south dakota minnesota montana and canada during the summerthis species of sparrow resides in grassland habitats these birds rely on the now diminishing tallgrass prairies mixed grass prairies and moister fescue prairies of northern united states and southern canada 2  the dwindling status of this habitat puts many animals whose lifestyles rely on these ecosystems in peril 3  land featuring woody vegetation and cultivated land is generally not a suitable environment for bairds sparrows to thrive indiet habits edit bairds sparrow feed on the ground picking up insects and grass seedsconservation status and threats edit there is some concern about the conservation status of bairds sparrows their numbers are reduced compared to historic numbers this species is listed under the iucn red list under the category of least concern 2  maintaining the original habitat is important for this species because artificial habitat recreation is not suitable for these birds fragmentation can lead to adverse conditions for bairds sparrows including increased nest parasitism 4 reproductionlife cycle edit bairds sparrows nest on the ground in either depressions or tufts of grass these nests are usually made out of grass and consist of two layers with finer material on the inside 5  these birds nest in small loose colonies a normal clutch size is usually two to six white gray eggs with brown spots 4  these birds are altricial and rely on parental care for survival after hatchingetymology of the name edit the bairds sparrow was named after the american naturalist spencer fullerton baird 1 historical fact edit the bairds sparrow was first described in north dakota in 1843 by john james audubon and another record of this species was not made for 29 years following its discovery 5 fun facts edit breeding populations of bairds sparrow fluctuate from year to year this is most likely the result of a variable environment including factors like wildfires drought and the movement of bison herds 5  when confronted with danger or a potential predator bairds sparrows may evade their foes by running on foot rather than flying away 5 references edit  a b birdlife international 2012 ammodramus bairdii iucn red list of threatened

chipping sparrow   wikipedia the chipping sparrow spizella passerina is a species of american sparrow a passerine bird in the family emberizidae it is widespread fairly tame and common across most of its north american range there are two subspecies the eastern chipping sparrow and the western chipping sparrow this bird is a partial migrant with northerly populations flying southwards in the fall to overwinter in mexico and the southern united states and flying northward again in spring it molts twice a year in its breeding plumage it has orangish rust upper parts gray head and underparts and a distinctive reddish cap in non breeding plumage the cap is brown and the facial markings are less distinct the song is a trill and the bird has a piercing flight call that can be heard while it is migrating at nightin the winter chipping sparrows are gregarious and form flocks sometimes associating with other bird species they mostly forage on the ground for seeds and other food items as well as clambering on plants and trees feeding on buds and small arthropods in the west of their range they breed mainly in coniferous forests but in the east they choose woodland farmland parks and gardens breeding starts in late april and may and the nest is often built in a treedescription edit an adult and nestlings in a tree nestthroughout the year adults are gray below and an orangish rust color above adults in alternate breeding plumage have a reddish cap a nearly white supercilium and a black trans ocular line running through the eye adults in basic nonbreeding plumage are less prominently marked with a brownish cap a dusky eyebrow and a dark eye linejuvenile chipping sparrows are prominently streaked below like non breeding adults they show a dark eye line extending both in front of and behind the eye the brownish cap and dusky eyebrow are variable but generally obscure in juvenilesvocalizations edit the song is a trill that varies considerably among birds within any particular region two broad classes of variation in the song of the chipping sparrow are the fast trill and the slow trill individual elements in the fast trill are run together about twice as fast as in the slow trill the fast trill sounds like a buzz or like someone snoring whereas the slow trill sounds like rapid finger tapping individual elements in the trill are very similar to a high pitch chi chi chi callthe flight call of the chipping sparrow is heard year round its flight call is piercing and pure tone lasting about 50 milliseconds it starts out around 9 khz then falls to 7 khz then rises again to 9 khz the flight call may be transliterated as seen chipping sparrows migrate by night and their flight calls are a characteristic sound of the night sky in spring and fall in the united states in the southern rockies and eastern great plains the chipping sparrow appears to be the most common nocturnal migrant judged by the number of flight calls detected per hour on typical nights in august in this region chipping sparrows may be heard at a rate of 15 flight calls per hour on better than average nights chipping sparrows occur at a rate of 60 flight calls per hour and on exceptional nights chipping sparrows flight calls are heard more than 200 times per hoursystematics edit chipping sparrows vary across their extensive north american range there is minor geographic variation in appearance and there is significant geographic variation in behavior ornithologists often divide the chipping sparrow into two major groups the eastern chipping sparrow and the western chipping sparrow however there is additional plumage and behavioral variation within the western groupat least two subspecies of chipping sparrows occur in western north america the widespread spizella passerina arizonae is associated with mountains and arid habitats of the western interior a pacific slope population constitutes subspecies s p stridula although these two races are both western and are often lumped together as the western chipping sparrow they do not necessarily form a single entity that stands apart from the eastern chipping sparrow s p passerinathe chipping sparrow is part of the family emberizidae and is not closely related to the old world sparrows of the family passeridae 2 ecology edit a chipping sparrow at a suburban bird feederin eastern north america chipping sparrows breed in woodlands farmlands and suburban and urban districts in western north america the chipping sparrow prefers conifer forests for breeding the chipping sparrow is partially migratory with almost all mid latitude and high latitude breeders withdrawing in winter to the southern united states and mexico on the wintering grounds and during migration chipping sparrows are gregarious forming tight flocks with other chipping sparrows or loose assemblages with other species such as eastern bluebirds and pine warblersthroughout the year chipping sparrows forage on the ground often in loose flocks their diet consists mainly of seeds and crumbs of mostly any food especially those fallen on the ground chipping sparrows frequently forage directly from forbs and grasses too at any time of the year especially in spring chipping sparrows may be seen in trees even up in the canopy where they forage on fresh buds and glean for arboreal arthropodsalthough they are wary chipping sparrows often allow close approach a quiet observer can often get to within 50–100 ft 15–30 m of one or more chipping sparrows feeding on the ground when spooked chipping sparrows fly a short distance to the nearest tree or fencerowin early spring the first migrants return from their wintering grounds in march but the bulk of migrants arrives throughout april males set up territories right away and their trilled songs make them conspicuous breeding begins as early as april but again most nesting activity occurs from late april to early may onwards 3  4 molt in the chipping sparrow follows the complex alternate strategy as usual for american sparrows it consequently has two molts per year as adults and three molts in their first year of life also called their first plumage cycle the chipping sparrows two adult molts occur in late summer and late winteralthough this birds original habitat was probably coniferous forest especially the eastern subspecies has adapted well to the

found in most parts of the world a small bird it has a typical length of 16 cm 63 in and a mass of 24–395 g 085–139 oz females and young birds are coloured pale brown and grey and males have brighter black white and brown markings one of about 25 species in the genus passer the house sparrow is native to most of europe the mediterranean region and much of asia its intentional or accidental introductions to many regions including parts of australia africa and the americas make it the most widely distributed wild birdthe house sparrow is strongly associated with human habitations and can live in urban or rural settings though found in widely varied habitats and climates it typically avoids extensive woodlands grasslands and deserts away from human development it feeds mostly on the seeds of grains and weeds but it is an opportunistic eater and commonly eats insects and many other foods its predators include domestic cats hawks owls and many other predatory birds and mammalsbecause of its numbers ubiquity and association with human settlements the house sparrow is culturally prominent it is extensively and usually unsuccessfully persecuted as an agricultural pest but it has also often been kept as a pet as well as being a food item and a symbol of lust and sexual potency and commonness and vulgarity though it is widespread and abundant its numbers have declined in some areas the animals conservation status is listed as least concern on the iucn red listdescription edit measurements and shape edit the house sparrow is typically about 16 cm 63 in long ranging from 14 to 18 cm 55 to 71 in 3  it is a compact bird with a full chest and a large rounded head its bill is stout and conical with a culmen length of 11–15 cm 043–059 in strongly built as an adaptation for eating seeds its tail is short at 52–65 cm 20–26 in long the wing chord is 67–89 cm 26–35 in and the tarsus is 16–25 cm 063–098 in 4  5  in mass the house sparrow ranges from 24 to 395 g 085 to 139 oz females usually are slightly smaller than males the median mass on the european continent for both sexes is about 30 g 11 oz and in more southerly subspecies is around 26 g 092 oz younger birds are smaller males are larger during the winter and females are larger during the breeding season 6  birds at higher latitudes colder climates and sometimes higher altitudes are larger under bergmanns rule both between and within subspecies 6  7  8  9 plumage edit male house sparrows in breeding left and nonbreeding right plumagethe plumage of the house sparrow is mostly different shades of grey and brown the sexes exhibit strong dimorphism the female is mostly buffish above and below while the male has boldly coloured head markings a reddish back and grey underparts 8  the male has a dark grey crown from the top of its bill to its back and chestnut brown flanking its crown on the sides of its head it has black around its bill on its throat and on the spaces between its bill and eyes lores it has a small white stripe between the lores and crown and small white spots immediately behind the eyes postoculars with black patches below and above them the underparts are pale grey or white as are the cheeks ear coverts and stripes at the base of the head the upper back and mantle are a warm brown with broad black streaks while the lower back rump and uppertail coverts are greyish brown 10 plumage of female house sparrowthe male is duller in fresh nonbreeding plumage with whitish tips on many feathers wear and preening expose many of the bright brown and black markings including most of the black throat and chest patch called the bib or badge 10  11  the badge is variable in width and general size and may signal social status or fitness this hypothesis has led to a veritable cottage industry of studies which have only conclusively shown that patches increase in size with age 12  the males bill is black in the breeding season and horn dark grey during the rest of the year 3 a close up of a male house sparrows headthe female has no black markings or grey crown its upperparts and head are brown with darker streaks around the mantle and a distinct pale supercilium its underparts are pale grey brown the females bill is brownish grey and becomes darker in breeding plumage approaching the black of the males bill 3  10 juveniles are similar to the adult female but deeper brown below and paler above with paler and less defined supercilia juveniles have broader buff feather edges and tend to have looser scruffier plumage like moulting adults juvenile males tend to have darker throats and white postoculars like adult males while juvenile female tend to have white throats however juveniles cannot be reliably sexed by plumage some juvenile males lack any markings of the adult male and some juvenile females have male features the bills of young birds are light yellow to straw paler than the females bill immature males have paler versions of the adult males markings which can be very indistinct in fresh plumage by their first breeding season young birds generally are indistinguishable from other adults though they may still be paler during their first year 3  10 a male calling in san franciscocalls recorded in englandmost house sparrow vocalisations are variations on its short and incessant chirping call transcribed as chirrup tschilp or philip this note is made as a contact call by flocking or resting birds or by males to proclaim nest ownership and invite pairing in the breeding season the male gives this call repetitively with emphasis and speed but not much rhythm forming what is described either as a song or an ecstatic call similar to a song 13  14  young birds also give a true song especially in captivity a warbling similar to that of the european greenfinch 15 aggressive males give a trilled version of their call transcribed as chur chur r r it it it it this call is also used by females in the breeding season to establish dominance over males while displacing them to feed young or incubate eggs 16  house sparrows give a nasal alarm call the basic sound of which is transcribed as quer and a shrill chree call in great distress 17  another vocalisation is the appeasement call a soft quee given to inhibit aggression usually given between birds of a mated pair 16  these vocalisations are not unique to the house sparrow but are shared with small variations by all sparrows 18 variation edit a male of subspecies p d indicus in kolkata indiasome variation is seen in the 12 subspecies of house sparrows which are divided into two groups the oriental p d indicus group and the palaearctic p d domesticus group birds of the p d domesticus group have grey cheeks while p d indicus group birds have white cheeks as well as bright colouration on the crown a smaller bill and a longer black bib 19  the subspecies p d tingitanus differs little from the nominate subspecies except in the worn breeding plumage of the male in which the head is speckled with black and underparts are paler 20  p d balearoibericus is slightly paler than the nominate but darker than p d bibilicus 21  p d bibilicus is paler than most subspecies but has the grey cheeks of p d domesticus group birds the similar p d persicus is paler and smaller and p d niloticus is nearly identical but smaller 20  of the less widespread p d indicus group subspecies p d hyrcanus is larger than p d indicus p d hufufae is paler p d bactrianus is larger and paler and p d parkini is larger and darker with more black on the breast than any other subspecies 20  22  23 identification edit the house sparrow can be confused with a number of other seed eating birds especially its relatives in the genus passer many of these relatives are smaller with an appearance that is neater or cuter as with the dead sea sparrow 24  the dull coloured female can often not be distinguished from other females and is nearly identical to the those of the spanish and italian sparrows 10  the eurasian tree sparrow is smaller and more slender with a chestnut crown and a black patch on each cheek 25  the male spanish sparrow and italian sparrow are distinguished by their chestnut crowns the sind sparrow is very similar but smaller with less black on the males throat and a distinct pale supercilium on the female 10 taxonomy and systematics edit the house sparrow was among the first animals to be given a scientific name in the modern system of biological classification since it was described by carl linnaeus in the 1758 10th edition of systema naturae it was described from a type specimen collected in sweden with the name fringilla domestica 26  27  later the genus name fringilla came to be used only for the common chaffinch and its relatives and the house sparrow has usually been placed in the genus passer created by french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson in 1760 28  29 the birds scientific name and its usual english name have the same meaning the latin word passer like the english word sparrow is a term for small active birds coming from a root word referring to speed 30  31  the latin word domesticus means belonging to the house like the common name a reference to its association with humans 32  the house sparrow is also called by a number of alternative english names including english sparrow chiefly in north america 33  34  and indian sparrow or indian house sparrow for the birds of the indian subcontinent and central asia 35  dialectal names include sparr sparrer spadger spadgick and philip mainly in southern england spug and spuggy mainly in northern england spur and sprig mainly in scotland 36  37  and spatzie or spotsie from the german spatz in north america 38 taxonomy edit the genus passer contains about 25 species depending on the authority 26 according to the handbook of the birds of the world 39  most passer species are dull coloured birds with short square tails and stubby conical beaks between 11 and 18 cm 43 and 71 in long 8  40  mitochondrial dna studies suggest that speciation in the genus occurred during the pleistocene and earlier while other evidence suggests speciation occurred 25000 to 15000 years ago 41  42  within passer the house sparrow is part of the palaearctic black bibbed sparrows group and a close relative of the mediterranean willow sparrows 39  43 the taxonomy of the house sparrow and its mediterranean relatives is highly complicated the common type of willow sparrow is the spanish sparrow which resembles the house sparrow in many respects 44  it frequently prefers wetter habitats than the house sparrow and it is often colonial and nomadic 45  in most of the mediterranean one or both species occur with some degree of hybridisation 46  in north africa the two species hybridise extensively forming highly variable mixed populations with a full range of characters from pure house sparrows to pure spanish sparrows 47  48  49 in much of italy a form apparently intermediate between the house and spanish sparrows is known as the italian sparrow it resembles a hybrid between the two species and is in other respects intermediate its specific status and origin are the subject of much debate 48  50  in the alps the italian sparrow intergrades over a roughly 20 km 12 mi strip with the house sparrow 51  but to the south it intergrades over the southern half of italy and some mediterranean islands with the spanish sparrow 48  on the mediterranean islands of malta gozo crete rhodes and karpathos the other apparently intermediate birds are of unknown status 48  52  53 subspecies edit a male of subspecies p d balearoibericus in istanbula large number of subspecies have been named of which 12 were recognised in the handbook of the birds of the world these subspecies are divided into two groups the palaearctic p d domesticus group and the oriental p d indicus group 39  several middle eastern subspecies including p d biblicus are sometimes considered a third intermediate group the subspecies p d indicus was described as a species and was considered to be distinct by many ornithologists during the 19th century 19 migratory birds of the subspecies p d bactrianus in the p d indicus group were recorded overlapping with p d domesticus birds without hybridising in the 1970s so the soviet scientists edward i gavrilov and m n korelov proposed the separation of the p d indicus group as a separate species 28  54  however p d indicus group and p d domesticus group birds intergrade in a large part of iran so this split is rarely recognised 39 in north america house sparrow populations are more differentiated than those in europe 7  this variation follows predictable patterns with birds at higher latitudes being larger and those in arid areas being paler 8  55  56  however how much this is caused by evolution or by environment is not clear 57  58  59  60  similar observations have been made in new zealand 61  and in south africa 62  the introduced house sparrow populations may be distinct enough to merit subspecies status especially in north america and southern africa 39  and american ornithologist harry church oberholser even gave the subspecies name p d plecticus to the paler birds of western north america 55 p d domesticus groupp d domesticus the nominate subspecies is found in most of europe across northern asia to sakhalin and kamchatka it is the most widely introduced subspecies 26 p d balearoibericus von jordans 1923 described from majorca is found in the balearic islands southern france the balkans and anatolia 39 p d tingitanus loche 1867 described from algeria is found in the maghreb from ajdabiya in libya to béni abbès in algeria and to moroccos atlantic coast it hybridises extensively with the spanish sparrow especially in the eastern part of its range 63 p d niloticus nicoll and bonhote 1909 described from faiyum egypt is found along the nile north of wadi halfa sudan it intergrades with bibilicus in the sinai and with rufidorsalis in a narrow zone around wadi halfa it has been recorded in somaliland 63  64 p d persicus zarudny and kudashev 1916 described from the karun river in khuzestan iran is found in the western and central iran south of the alborz mountains intergrading with indicus in eastern iran and afghanistan 39  63  65 p d biblicus hartert 1910 described from palestine is found in the middle east from cyprus and south eastern turkey to the sinai in the west and from azerbaijan to kuwait in the east 39  63 p d indicus groupp d hyrcanus zarudny and kudashev 1916 described from gorgan iran is found along the southern coast of the caspian sea from gorgan to south eastern azerbaijan it intergrades with p d persicus in the alborz mountains and with p d bibilicus to the west it is the subspecies with the smallest range 39  63 p d bactrianus zarudny and kudashev 1916 described from tashkent is found in southern kazakhstan to the tian shan and northern iran and afghanistan it intergrades with persicus in baluchistan and with indicus across central afghanistan unlike most other house sparrow subspecies it is almost entirely migratory wintering in the plains of the northern indian subcontinent it is found in open country rather than in settlements which are occupied by the eurasian tree sparrow in its range 39  63  there is an exceptional record from sudan 64 p d parkini whistler 1920 described from srinagar kashmir is found in the western himalayas from the pamir mountains to south eastern nepal it is migratory like p d bactrianus 19  63 p d indicus jardine and selby 1831 described from bangalore is found in the indian subcontinent south of the himalayas in sri lanka western southeast asia eastern iran south western arabia and southern israel 19  39  63 p d hufufae ticehurst and cheeseman 1924 described from hofuf in saudi arabia is found in north eastern arabia 63  66 p d rufidorsalis c l brehm 1855 described from khartoum sudan is found in the nile valley from wadi halfa south to renk in northern south sudan 63  64  and in eastern sudan northern ethiopia to the red sea coast in eritrea 39  it has also been introduced to mohéli in the comoros 67 distribution and habitat edit house sparrows perching on a roof during winter in the southern alps of new zealandthe house sparrow originated in the middle east and spread along with agriculture to most of eurasia and parts of north africa 68  since the mid 19th century it has reached most of the world chiefly due to deliberate introductions but also through natural and shipborne dispersal 69  its introduced range encompasses most of north america central america southern south america southern africa part of west africa australia new zealand and islands throughout the world 70  it has greatly extended its range in northern eurasia since the 1850s 71  and continues to do so as was shown by the colonisations around 1990 of iceland and rishiri island japan 72  the extent of its range makes it the most widely distributed wild bird on the planet 70 introductions edit the house sparrow has become highly successful in most parts of the world where it has been introduced this is mostly due to its early adaptation to living with humans and its adaptability to a wide range of conditions 73  74  other factors may include its robust immune response compared to the eurasian tree sparrow 75  where introduced it can extend its range quickly sometimes at a rate over 230 km 140 mi per year 76  in many parts of the world it has been characterised as a pest and poses a threat to native birds 77  78  a few introductions have died out or been of limited success such as those to greenland and cape verde 79 the first of many successful introductions to north america occurred when birds from england were released in new york city in 1852  80  81  to control the ravages of the linden moth 82  the house sparrow now occurs from the northwest territories to southern panama 4  and it is one of the most abundant birds in north america 77  the house sparrow was first introduced to australia in 1863 at melbourne and is common throughout the eastern part of the continent 79  but has been prevented from establishing itself in western australia where every house sparrow found in the state is killed 83  house sparrows were introduced in new zealand in 1859 and from there reached many of the pacific islands including hawaii 84 in southern africa birds of both the european subspecies p d domesticus and the indian subspecies p d indicus were introduced around 1900 birds of p d domesticus ancestry are confined to a few towns while p d indicus birds have spread rapidly reaching tanzania in the 1980s despite this success native relatives such as the cape sparrow also occur in towns competing successfully with it 79  85  in south america it was first introduced near buenos aires around 1870 and quickly became common in most of the southern part of the continent it now occurs almost continuously from tierra del fuego to the fringes of amazonia with isolated populations as far north as coastal venezuela 79  86  87 habitat edit the house sparrow is closely associated with human habitation and cultivation 88  it is not an obligate commensal of humans as some have suggested central asian house sparrows usually breed away from humans in open country 89  and birds elsewhere are occasionally found away from humans 88  90  91  the only terrestrial habitats that the house sparrow does not inhabit are dense forest and tundra well adapted to living around humans it frequently lives and even breeds indoors especially in factories warehouses and zoos 88  it has been recorded breeding in an english coal mine 640 m 2100 ft below ground 92  and feeding on the empire state buildings observation deck at night 93  it reaches its greatest densities in urban centres but its reproductive success is greater in suburbs where insects are more abundant 88  94  on a larger scale it is most abundant in wheat growing areas such as the midwestern united states 95 it tolerates a variety of climates but prefers drier conditions especially in moist tropical climates 79  88  it has several adaptations to dry areas including a high salt tolerance 96  and an ability to survive without water by ingesting berries 97  in most of eastern asia the house sparrow is entirely absent replaced by the eurasian tree sparrow 98  where these two species overlap the house sparrow is usually more common than the eurasian tree sparrow but one species may replace the other in a manner that ornithologist maud doria haviland described as random or even capricious 99  in most of its range the house sparrow is extremely common despite some declines 100  but in marginal habitats such as rainforest or mountain ranges its distribution can be spotty 88 behaviour edit the house sparrow often bathes in water at left or in dust at rightsocial behaviour edit the house sparrow is a very social bird it is gregarious at all seasons when feeding often forming flocks with other types of birds 101  it roosts communally its nests are usually grouped together in clumps and it engages in social activities such as dust or water bathing and social singing in which birds call together in bushes 102  103  the house sparrow feeds mostly on the ground but it flocks in trees and bushes 102  at feeding stations and nests female house sparrows are dominant despite their smaller size and in the reproductive period usually spring or summer being dominant they can fight for males 104  105 sleep and roosting edit house sparrows sleep with the bill tucked underneath the scapular feathers 106  outside of the reproductive season they often roost communally in trees or shrubs much communal chirping occurs before and after the birds settle in the roost in the evening as well as before the birds leave the roost in the morning 102  some congregating sites separate from the roost may be visited by the birds prior to settling in for the night 107 body maintenance edit dust or water bathing is common and often occurs in groups anting is rare 108  head scratching is done with the leg over the drooped wing 107 feeding edit female foraging in germanyas an adult the house sparrow mostly feeds on the seeds of grains and weeds but it is opportunistic and adaptable and eats whatever foods are available 109  in towns and cities it often scavenges for food in garbage containers and congregates in the outdoors of restaurants and other eating establishments to feed on leftover food and crumbs it can perform complex tasks to obtain food such as opening automatic doors to enter supermarkets 110  clinging to hotel walls to watch vacationers on their balconies 111  and nectar robbing kowhai flowers 112  in common with many other birds the house sparrow requires grit to digest the harder items in its diet grit can be either stone often grains of masonry or the shells of eggs or snails oblong and rough grains are preferred 113  114 several studies of the house sparrow in temperate agricultural areas have found the proportion of seeds in its diet to be about 90 109  115  116  it will eat almost any seeds but where it has a choice it prefers oats and wheat 117  in urban areas the house sparrow feeds largely on food provided directly or indirectly by humans such as bread though it prefers raw seeds 116  118  the house sparrow also eats some plant matter besides seeds including buds berries and fruits such as grapes and cherries 97  116  in temperate areas the house sparrow has an unusual habit of tearing flowers especially yellow ones in the spring 119 animals form another important part of the house sparrows diet chiefly insects of which beetles caterpillars dipteran flies and aphids are especially important various noninsect arthropods are eaten as are molluscs and crustaceans where available earthworms and even vertebrates such as lizards and frogs 109  young house sparrows are fed mostly on insects until about 15 days after hatching 120  they are also given small quantities of seeds spiders and grit in most places grasshoppers and crickets are the most abundant foods of nestlings 121  true bugs ants sawflies and beetles are also important but house sparrows take advantage of whatever foods are abundant to feed their young 121  122  123  house sparrows have been observed stealing prey from other birds including american robins 4 locomotion edit the house sparrows flight is direct not undulating and flapping averaging 455 kmh 283 mph and about 15 wingbeats per second 107  124  on the ground the house sparrow typically hops rather than walks it can swim when pressed to do so by pursuit from predators captive birds have been recorded diving and swimming short distances under water 107 dispersal and migration edit most house sparrows do not move more than a few kilometres during their lifetimes however limited migration occurs in all regions some young birds disperse long distances especially on coasts and mountain birds move to lower elevations in winter 102  125  126  two subspecies p d bactrianus and p d parkini are predominantly migratory unlike the birds in sedentary populations that migrate birds of migratory subspecies prepare for migration by putting on weight 102 breeding edit a pair of the subspecies p d indicus mating in kolkatahouse sparrows can breed in the breeding season immediately following their hatching and sometimes attempt to do so some birds breeding for the first time in tropical areas are only a few months old and still have juvenile plumage 127  birds breeding for the first time are rarely successful in raising young and reproductive success increases with age as older birds breed earlier in the breeding season and fledge more young 128  as the breeding season approaches hormone releases trigger enormous increases in the size of the sexual organs and changes in day length lead males to start calling by nesting sites 129  130  the timing of mating and egg laying varies geographically and between specific locations and years because a sufficient supply of insects is needed for egg formation and feeding nestlings 131 males take up nesting sites before the breeding season by frequently calling beside them unmated males start nest construction and call particularly frequently to attract females when a female approaches a male during this period the male displays by moving up and down while drooping and shivering his wings pushing up his head raising and spreading his tail and showing his bib 131  males may try to mate with females while calling or displaying in response a female will adopt a threatening posture and attack a male before flying away pursued by the male the male displays in front of her attracting other males which also pursue and display to the female this group display usually does not immediately result in copulations 131  other males usually do not copulate with the female 132  133  copulation is typically initiated by the female giving a soft dee dee dee call to the male birds of a pair copulate frequently until the female is laying eggs and the male mounts the female repeatedly each time a pair mates 131 the house sparrow is monogamous and typically mates for life birds from pairs often engage in extra pair copulations so about 15 of house sparrow fledglings are unrelated to their mothers mate 134  male house sparrows guard their mates carefully to avoid being cuckolded and most extra pair copulation occurs away from nest sites 132  135  males may sometimes have multiple mates and bigamy is mostly limited by aggression between females 136  many birds do not find a nest and a mate and instead may serve as helpers around the nest for mated pairs a role which increases the chances of being chosen to replace a lost mate lost mates of both sexes can be replaced quickly during the breeding season 132  137  the formation of a pair and the bond between the two birds is tied to the holding of a nest site though paired house sparrows can recognise each other away from the nest 131 nesting edit female bringing food for young in a nest made in a tree hole in californianest sites are varied though cavities are preferred nests are most frequently built in the eaves and other crevices of houses holes in cliffs and banks or tree hollows are also used 138  139  a sparrow sometimes excavates its own nests in sandy banks or rotten branches but more frequently uses the nests of other birds such as those of swallows in banks and cliffs and old tree cavity nests 138  it usually uses deserted nests though sometimes it usurps active ones 138  140  tree hollows are more commonly used in north america than in europe 138  putting the sparrows in competition with bluebirds and other north american cavity nesters and thereby contributing to their population declines 77 especially in warmer areas the house sparrow may build its nests in the open on the branches of trees especially evergreens and hawthorns or in the nests of large birds such as storks or magpies 131  138  141  in open nesting sites breeding success tends to be lower since breeding begins late and the nest can easily be destroyed or damaged by storms 138  142  less common nesting sites include street lights and neon signs favoured for their warmth and the old open topped nests of other songbirds which are then domed over 138  139 the nest is usually domed though it may lack a roof in enclosed sites 138  it has an outer layer of stems and roots a middle layer of dead grass and leaves and a lining of feathers as well as of paper and other soft materials 139  nests typically have external dimensions of 20 × 30 cm 8 × 12 in 131  but their size varies greatly 139  the building of the nest is initiated by the unmated male while displaying to females the female assists in building but is less active than the male 138  some nest building occurs throughout the year especially after moult in autumn in colder areas house sparrows build specially created roost nests or roost in street lights to avoid losing heat during the winter 138  143  house sparrows do not hold territories but they defend their nests aggressively against intruders of the same sex 138 house sparrows nests support a wide range of scavenging insects including nest flies such as neottiophilum praestum protocalliphora blowflies 144  145  and over 1400 species of beetle 146 eggs and young edit clutches usually comprise four or five eggs though numbers from one to 10 have been recorded at least two clutches are usually laid and up to seven a year may be laid in the tropics or four a year in temperate latitudes when fewer clutches are laid in a year especially at higher latitudes the number of eggs per clutch is greater central asian house sparrows which migrate and have only one clutch a year average 65 eggs in a clutch clutch size is also affected by environmental and seasonal conditions female age and breeding density 147  148 some intraspecific brood parasitism occurs and instances of unusually large numbers of eggs in a nest may be the result of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females 147  149  the house sparrow is a victim of interspecific brood parasites but only rarely since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter and it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites 150  151  in turn the house sparrow has once been recorded as a brood parasite of the american cliff swallow 149  152 a juvenile showing its pink bill and obvious nestling gape—the soft swollen base which becomes harder and less swollen as the bird maturesthe eggs are white bluish white or greenish white spotted with brown or grey 107  subelliptical in shape 8  they range from 20 to 22 mm 079 to 087 in in length and 14 to 16 mm 055 to 063 in in width 4  have an average mass of 29 g 010 oz 153  and an average surface area of 918 cm2 1423 in2 154  eggs from the tropical subspecies are distinctly smaller 155  156  eggs begin to develop with the deposition of yolk in the ovary a few days before ovulation in the day between ovulation and laying egg white forms followed by eggshell 157  eggs laid later in a clutch are larger as are those laid by larger females and egg size is hereditary eggs decrease slightly in size from laying to hatching 158  the yolk comprises 25 of the egg the egg white 68 and the shell 7 eggs are watery being 79 liquid and otherwise mostly protein 159 the female develops a brood patch of bare skin and plays the main part in incubating the eggs the male helps but can only cover the eggs rather than truly incubate them the female spends the night incubating during this period while the male roosts near the nest 147  eggs hatch at the same time after a short incubation period lasting 11–14 days and exceptionally for as many as 17 or as few as 9 8  131  160  the length of the incubation period decreases as ambient temperature increases later in the breeding season 161 a female feeding a fledglingyoung house sparrows remain in the nest for 11 to 23 days normally 14 to 16 days 107  161  162  during this time they are fed by both parents as newly hatched house sparrows do not have sufficient insulation they are brooded for a few days or longer in cold conditions 161  163  the parents swallow the droppings produced by the hatchlings during the first few days later the droppings are moved up to 20 m 66 ft away from the nest 163  164 the chicks eyes open after about four days and at an age of about eight days the young birds get their first down 107  162  if both parents perish the ensuing intensive begging sounds of the young often attract replacement parents which feed them until they can sustain themselves 163  165  all the young in the nest leave it during the same period of a few hours at this stage they are normally able to fly they start feeding themselves partly after one or two days and sustain themselves completely after 7 to 10 days 14 at the latest 166 survival edit in adult house sparrows annual survival is 45–65 167  after fledging and leaving the care of their parents young sparrows have a high mortality rate which lessens as they grow older and more experienced only about 20–25 of birds hatched survive to their first breeding season 168  the oldest known wild house sparrow lived for nearly two decades it was found dead 19 years and 9 months after it was ringed in denmark 169  the oldest recorded captive house sparrow lived for 23 years 170  the typical ratio of males to females in a population is uncertain due to problems in collecting data but a very slight preponderance of males at all ages is usual 171 predation edit a male being eaten by a cat domestic cats are one of the main predators of the house sparrowthe house sparrows main predators are cats and birds of prey but many other animals prey on them including corvids squirrels 172  and even humans—the house sparrow has been consumed in the past by people in many parts of the world and it still is in parts of the mediterranean 173  most species of birds of prey have been recorded preying on the house sparrow in places where records are extensive accipiters and the merlin in particular are major predators though cats are likely to have a greater impact on house sparrow populations 172  the house sparrow is also a common victim of roadkill on european roads it is the bird most frequently found dead 174 parasites and disease edit the house sparrow is host to a huge number of parasites and diseases and the effect of most is unknown ornithologist ted r anderson listed thousands noting that his list was incomplete 175  the commonly recorded bacterial pathogens of the house sparrow are often those common in humans and include salmonella and escherichia coli 176  salmonella is common in the house sparrow and a comprehensive study of house sparrow disease found it in 13 of sparrows tested salmonella epidemics in the spring and winter can kill large numbers of sparrows 175  the house sparrow hosts avian pox and avian malaria which it has spread to the native forest birds of hawaii 177  many of the diseases hosted by the house sparrow are also present in humans and domestic animals for which the house sparrow acts as a reservoir host 178  arboviruses such as the west nile virus which most commonly infect insects and mammals survive winters in temperate areas by going dormant in birds such as the house sparrow 175  179 a few records indicate disease extirpating house sparrow populations especially from scottish islands but this seems to be rare 180 the house sparrow is infested by a number of external parasites which usually cause little harm to adult sparrows in europe the most common mite found on sparrows is proctophyllodes the most common ticks are argas reflexus and ixodes arboricola and the most common flea on the house sparrow is ceratophyllus gallinae a number of chewing lice occupy different niches on the house sparrows body menacanthus lice occur across the house sparrows body where they feed on blood and feathers while brueelia lice feed on feathers and philopterus fringillae occurs on the head 144 physiology edit house sparrows express strong circadian rhythms of activity in the laboratory they were among the first bird species to be seriously studied in terms of their circadian activity and photoperiodism in part because of their availability and adaptability in captivity but also because they can find their way and remain rhythmic in constant darkness 181  182  such studies have found that the pineal gland is a central part of the house sparrows circadian system removal of the pineal eliminates the circadian rhythm of activity 183  and transplant of the pineal into another individual confers to this individual the rhythm phase of the donor bird 184  the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus have also been shown to be an important component of the circadian system of house sparrows 185  the photoreceptors involved in the synchronisation of the circadian clock to the external light dark cycle are located in the brain and can be stimulated by light reaching them directly though the skull as revealed by experiments in which blind sparrows which normally can still synchronise to the light dark cycle failed to do so once india ink was injected as a screen under the skin on top of their skulls 186 similarly even when blind house sparrows continue to be photoperiodic ie show reproductive development when the days are long but not when the days are short this response is stronger when the feathers on top of the head are plucked and is eliminated when india ink is injected under the skin at the top of the head showing that the photoreceptors involved in the photoperiodic response to day length are located inside the brain 187 house sparrows have also been used in studies of nonphotic entrainment ie synchronisation to an external cycle other than light and dark for example in constant darkness a situation in which the birds would normally reveal their endogenous non 24 hour free running rhythms of activity they instead show 24 hour periodicity if they are exposed to two hours of chirp playbacks every 24 hours matching their daily activity onsets with the daily playback onsets 188  house sparrows in constant dim light can also be entrained to a daily cycle based on the presence of food 189  finally house sparrows in constant darkness can be entrained to a cycle of high and low temperature but only if the difference between the two temperatures is large 38 versus 6°c some of the tested sparrows matched their activity to the warm phase and others to the cold phase 190 relationships with humans edit the house sparrow is closely associated with humans they are believed to have become associated with humans around 10000 years ago subspecies p d bactrianus is least associated with humans and considered to be evolutionarily closer to the ancestral noncommensal populations 191  usually it is regarded as a pest since it consumes agricultural products and spreads disease to humans and their domestic animals 192  even birdwatchers often hold it in little regard because of its molestation of other birds 77  in most of the world the house sparrow is not protected by law attempts to control house sparrows include the trapping poisoning or shooting of adults the destruction of their nests and eggs or less directly blocking nest holes and scaring off sparrows with noise glue or porcupine wire 193  however the house sparrow can be beneficial to humans as well especially by eating insect pests and attempts at the large scale control of the house sparrow have failed 39 the house sparrow has long been used as a food item from around 1560 to at least the 19th century in northern europe earthenware sparrow pots were hung from eaves to attract nesting birds so the young could be readily harvested wild birds were trapped in nets in large numbers and sparrow pie was a traditional dish thought because of the association of sparrows with lechery to have aphrodisiac properties sparrows were also trapped as food for falconers birds and zoo animals in the early part of the 20th century sparrow clubs culled many millions of birds and eggs in an attempt to control numbers of this perceived pest but with only a localised impact on numbers 194  house sparrows have been kept as pets at many times in history though they have no bright plumage or attractive songs and raising them is difficult 195 the house sparrow has an extremely large range and population and is not seriously threatened by human activities so it is assessed as least concern for conservation on the iucn red list 1  however populations have been declining in many parts of the world 196  197  198  these declines were first noticed in north america where they were initially attributed to the spread of the house finch but have been most severe in western europe 199  200  declines have not been universal as no serious declines have been reported from eastern europe but have even occurred in australia where the house sparrow was introduced recently 201 in great britain populations peaked in the early 1970s 202  but have since declined by 68 overall 203  and about 90 in some regions 204  205  in london the house sparrow almost disappeared from the central city 204  the numbers of house sparrows in the netherlands have dropped in half since the 1980s 94  so the house sparrow is even considered an endangered species 206  this status came to widespread attention after a female house sparrow referred to as the dominomus was killed after knocking down dominoes arranged as part of an attempt to set a world record 207  these declines are not unprecedented as similar reductions in population occurred when the internal combustion engine replaced horses in the 1920s and a major source of food in the form of grain spillage was lost 208  209 various causes for the dramatic decreases in population have been proposed including predation in particular by eurasian sparrowhawks 210  211  212  electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones 213  and diseases 214  a shortage of nesting sites caused by changes in urban building design is probably a factor and conservation organisations have encouraged the use of special nest boxes for sparrows 214  215  216  217  218  unreliable source  a primary cause of the decline seems to be an insufficient supply of insect food for nestling sparrows 214  219  declines in insect populations result from an increase of monoculture crops the heavy use of pesticides 220  221  222  the replacement of native plants in cities with introduced plants and parking areas 223  224  and possibly the introduction of unleaded petrol which produces toxic compounds such as methyl nitrite 225 protecting insect habitats on farms 226  227  and planting native plants in cities benefit the house sparrow as does establishing urban green spaces 228  229  to raise awareness of threats to the house sparrow world sparrow day has been celebrated on 20 march across the world since 2010 230  over the recent years the house sparrow population has been on the decline in many asian countries and this decline is quite evident in indiato promote the conservation of these birds in 2012 the then chief minister of delhi ms sheila dikshit declared the house sparrow as the state bird of delhi 231  232 cultural associations edit to many people across the world the house sparrow is the most familiar wild animal and because of its association with humans and familiarity it is frequently used to represent the common and vulgar or the lewd 233  one of the reasons for the introduction of house sparrows throughout the world was their association with the european homeland of many immigrants 81  birds usually described later as sparrows are referred to in many works of ancient literature and religious texts in europe and western asia these references may not always refer specifically to the house sparrow or even to small seed eating birds but later writers who were inspired by these texts often had the house sparrow in mind 39  233  234  in particular sparrows were associated by the ancient greeks with aphrodite the goddess of love due to their perceived lustfulness an association echoed by later writers such as chaucer and shakespeare 39  195  233  235  jesuss use of sparrows as an example of divine providence in the gospel of matthew 236  also inspired later references such as that in shakespeares hamlet 233  and the gospel hymn his eye is on the sparrow 237 the house sparrow is only represented in ancient egyptian art very rarely but an egyptian hieroglyph is based on it the sparrow hieroglyph had no phonetic value and was used as a determinative in words to indicate small narrow or bad 238  an alternative view is that the hieroglyph meant a prolific man or the revolution of a year 239 see also edit references edit  a b birdlife international

fox sparrow   wikipedia the fox sparrow passerella iliaca is a large american sparrow it is the only member of the genus passerella although some authors split the species into four sub species see belowtaxonomy edit more specific information regarding plumage is available in the accounts for the various taxap i iliaca – red fox sparrow merrem 1786 is the generally central and east coast taxon in the genus passerella this is the brightest colored groupp i unalaschcensis – sooty fox sparrow gmelin jf 1789 is the west coast taxon in the genus passerella it is browner and darker than the red fox sparrowp i schistacea – slate colored fox sparrow baird sf 1858 is the rocky mountain taxon in the genus passerella it is a tiny billed bird with a gray head and mantle brown wings brown breast streaks and a russet tailp i megarhyncha – thick billed fox sparrow baird sf 1858 is the sierra nevada taxon in the genus passerella this group features a particularly thick bill as its name would suggestdescription edit adults are amongst the largest sparrows heavily spotted and streaked underneath all feature a messy central breast spot though it is less noticeable on the thick billed and slate colored varieties plumage varies markedly from one group to anotherbehavior edit these birds forage by scratching the ground which makes them vulnerable to cats and other predators though they are generally plentiful fox sparrows migrate on the west coast of the united statesthey mainly eat seeds and insects as well as some berries coastal fox sparrows may also eat crustaceansreproduction edit fox sparrows nest in wooded areas across northern canada and the west coast of north america from alaska to california they nest either in a sheltered location on the ground or low in trees or shrubs a nest typically contains two to five pale green to greenish white eggs speckled with reddish brown 2 systematics edit the review by zink amp weckstein 2003 3  which added mtdna cytochrome b nadh dehydrogenase subunit 2 and 3 and d loop sequence confirmed the four subspecies groups 4  of the fox sparrow that were outlined by the initial limited mtdna haplotype comparison zink 1994 5  these should probably be recognized as separate species but this was deferred for further analysis of hybridization particularly the contact zones between the slate colored and thick billed fox sparrows which are only weakly distinct morphologically were of interest the other groups were found to be distinct far earlier 6  a further study of the nuclear genome using microsatellites showed similar separation between the four groups 7 the combined molecular data is unable to resolve the interrelationship of the subspecies group and of subspecies in these but aids in confirming the distinctness of the thick billed group 3  biogeography indicates that the coastal populations were probably isolated during an epoch of glaciation of the rocky mountains range but this is also not very helpful in resolving the remaining problems of within group diversity and inter group relationshipsreferences edit  birdlife international 2012 passerella iliaca iucn red list of threatened

harriss sparrow   wikipedia the immature harriss sparrow has a brown striped head as opposed to the black striped head of the mature breeding bird note the orange pink billthe harriss sparrow zonotrichia querula is a large sparrow their breeding habitat is the north part of central canada primarily the northwest territories and nunavut ranging slightly into northern manitoba and saskatchewan in fact this bird is canadas only endemic breeder in the winter they migrate to the great plains states of the united states from lower south dakota to upper texas the common name of this species commemorates the american amateur ornithologist edward harris 1799–1863description edit this species is the largest of the sparrows in the family emberizidae though other superficially dissimilar species in the family may slightly exceed them in size they range in total length from 17 to 20 cm 67 to 79 in with a 27 cm 11 in wingspan and weigh from 26 to 49 g 092 to 173 oz among standard measurements the wing chord is 77 to 92 cm 30 to 36 in the tail is 76 to 88 cm 30 to 35 in the bill is 11 to 14 cm 043 to 055 in and the tarsus is 22 to 25 cm 087 to 098 inthis is a very distinctive looking species breeding plumage birds have conspicuous pink bills and black on the crown face throat and upper breast contrasting with grey on the sides of the head and neck the back is brown overlaid with heavy black streaking there are two white wing bars breeding birds have white lower underparts with some black mottling on flanks non breeding adults are more buffy than grey and brown with reduced or absent black markings and often have whitish scalloping on the head and throat immatures have less black than all adult plumages normally marked with a white chin and throat a black malar stripe and a broad smudgy black breast band juveniles have a brownish crown streaked with black and fine dark streaks and some broader black markings on the underside birds moult from july to september confusion of wintering birds is possible with the winter lapland longspur calcarius lapponicus but that species is much shorter tailed with white outer rectrices has rich rufous in greater coverts and is strictly terrestrial on open groundthe song of the harriss sparrow is usually delivered from a high perch the song consists of a series of one or more clear high wavering whistles followed by another series in higher or lower pitch they have also been known to call out a strong metallic chink as well as some variable musical twitteringhabitat edit the harriss sparrow breeds in stunted coniferous forests and adjacent scrubs especially areas of the grand boreal forests where stands of spruce abut mossy bogs they often nest near the northern limit of tree growth in the forest tundra ecotone typical plant life in the breeding grounds consist of white and black spruce picea glauca and p mariana and american larch larix laricina dwarf birch willow and wet sedge meadow and shrubby tundra with dwarf ericadlichen plant life 2  the species migrates mainly through tallgrass prairies to winter in open woodlands woodland edges and clearings hedgerows dense riparian thickets and around brush piles the harriss sparrow regularly occurs at feeders in suburban and rural gardens during the wintertime they typically avoid dry shortgrass prairies and dense woods during winter migrating sparrows may be attracted to marsh elder iva annua and giant ragweed ambrosia trifida 3 behaviour edit migration edit spring migration commences around late february with birds arriving on breeding grounds but may sparrows arrive on their wintering grounds as early as late october though mostly during november and early december records from banff national park suggest harriss sparrows use mountain valleys as migration routes 4  apparently fall migration is less strict than spring migration as harriss sparrows regularly wander about prairie providences in canada until harsh weather forces them south 5 feeding ecology edit the harriss sparrow generally feeds on the ground scratching vigorously in the leaves and soil for food observed foraging during nesting was 85 ground gleaning 6  during the breeding season individuals typically forage alone or with a mate primary in the diet 66 of stomach contents of breeding birds are seeds largely of carex sedges grasses and scirpus bulrush 7  also important in the breeding season diet are fruits largely black crowberry empetrum nigrum mountain bearberry arctostaphylos alpina and various vaccinium species pine needles flower buds and blossoms are eaten supplementally larval invertebrates are important from june to september in the diet as available prey becomes more common at this point 6  the principal preferred animal prey includes beetles flies bees ants moths butterflies spiders cicadas aphids and leafhoppers 7  the diet of wintering harriss sparrow is less well known and has not been quantitatively studiedsociality edit males of this species often group together to sing at dusk in winter flocks harriss sparrows maintain linear dominance hierarchies that determine access to food and roost sites the most dominant birds are the oldest males which usually also have the largest bibs jump fights between males occasionally occur consisting of birds facing off then leaping at each other pecking clawing and beating each other with wings testosterone alone does not affect the dominance status of winter birds if first winter birds have their feathers dyed black creating an artificially large bib they rise in the dominance hierarchy past females and other young males 8  it is usually found in flocks up to several dozen in winter individuals regularly wandering outside of the normal range and turning up in flocks of other sparrow speciesreproduction edit breeding pairs establish a territory of about 200 to 300 km2 77 to 116 sq mi clarification needed  nests are usually constructed in early to mid june eggs are usually laid by late june to july depending on when snow in their habitat completely melts 9  in this species nests are placed in a well hidden spot on the ground underneath a thick bush or small conifer or in mossy depression in thick grass clumps both parents build a cup nest out of twigs grass moss and lichens and line it with fine grasses from three to five eggs are laid being variably greenish or greyish in colour with differing degrees of small reddish brown spot eggs average 222 mm × 165 mm 087 in × 065 in in size and weigh approximately 33 g 012 oz 6  the incubation stage lasts for approximately 135 days the chicks weigh about 31 g 011 oz upon hatching the young will fledge in about 8 to 10 days from july 4 to july 13 about 3 weeks after fledging the young become independent of their parents 10  second clutches may be laid if the first is destroyed usually prolonging the brooding period a further three days for the parent sparrows 10  the species is arguably the least studied north american sparrow due to its isolated nesting territory the first nest ever found was discovered 1931 in churchill manitoba by ornithologist george m sutton 91 years after the species was initially described 11 longevity and mortality edit the harriss sparrow has lived for up to 11 years and 8 months in the wild predators on the nest can including varied terrestrial mammals including arctic ground squirrels spermophilus parryii and stoats mustela erminea 12  harriss sparrows provide an easy target for these predators due to the location of their nests on the ground gray jays perisoreus canadensis northern shrikes lanius excubitor and merlins falco columbarius can be a serious predators at the nest including both nestlings and adults 6  shrikes sharp shinned hawks accipiter striatus and great horned owls bubo virginianus are known predators of wintering harriss sparrows 5  as an anti predator adaptation harriss sparrows fly up into trees when startled by other animals usually issuing an alarm call in the process weenk they duck down to the ground when threatened by other birds they also produce alarm calls when threatened to alert others 6 conservation status edit this species is classified as being of least concern by the iucn 1  the total population is estimated at 37 million individuals however the species came to be included on the audubon watchlist due to the fact that there appears to have been a decline in the number of birds observed in annual christmas bird counts across north america the species is fairly adaptable in wintering habitat and feeding opportunities and its habitat is isolated enough to be out of reach for heavy human development which makes the recent declines something of a mystery 13  the species breeds on the northern edge of boreal forests and it is possible that habitat change in their breeding range is effecting this sparrow the boreal forest beyond heavy logging has been adversely effected by increased wildfire and declining soil quality both of which are likely correlated to global climate change 14  15 references edit  a b birdlife international 2012 zonotrichia

le contes sparrow   wikipedia the le conte’s sparrow ammodramus leconteii is one of the smallest sparrow species in north america 2 it is a very secretive bird that prefers to spend most of its time on the ground under the cover of tall grasses 2  they are typically very difficult to flush often only flushing at a distance of 1–3 m as they prefer to run across the ground 3  when they do emerge they rarely fly more than a foot or two above the grass and often descend again within a few meters 2  4  because it is so rarely seen there are still many gaps in knowledge about the le conte’s sparrow nests are often very hard to find and individuals are more often identified by sound than by sightdescription edit the le conte’s sparrow is a small sparrow with a relatively large head short grey bill and short pointed tail it has a buffy yellow orange face with grey cheeks and a dark brown crown with a white central stripe the nape of the neck is lilac grey with chestnut streaks and the back is streaked with brown and beige its belly is off white while the breast and sides are a buffy orange yellow with dark brown streaks the feet and legs are a brownish pink colourle contes sparrow hiding under the cover of grassmeasurements edit the measurements for both sexes are 3 length 47 in 12 cmwingspan 71 in18 cmweight 04 06 oz 12 16 gsimilar birds edit the le contes sparrow is commonly mistaken for 4  5 there has been a recorded case of a le contes sparrow hybridized with a nelsons sparrow in june 1949 in ontario 2 taxonomy edit the le conte’s sparrow is a member of the order passerifomes which are the perching birds sometimes less accurately referred to as the songbirds it is from the family emberizidae which is characterized by species of small birds with bills adapted to seed eating most members of this family are referred to as sparrows in north america and as buntings in europe within the sparrows the le conte’s falls within the genus ammodramus which are the ground loving sparrows which prefer staying in tall thick grasses to perching on trees all of the species for which the le conte’s is most easily confused nelson’s sparrow grasshopper sparrow etc belong to this genusthe le conte’s sparrow was discovered by john james audubon and it was thought that he named this bird after a friend doctor le conte it is generally believed that he meant john lawrence le conte although some feel that he was referring to another john le conte also a doctor and john lawrences cousinhabitat and distribution edit the le conte’s sparrow breeds in select areas of north eastern british columbia across alberta saskatchewan and southern manitoba as well as central ontario and into quebec and as far south as northern michigan montana and minnesota it winters in the south eastern united states as far west as central texas and as far north as central illinois and missouri 6 habitat edit le conte’s sparrow prefers moist open grassy areas with sufficient vegetation cover to provide shelter known habitat use includes meadows fields crop stubble shallow marshy edges prairie and occasionally fens and lake shores within the boreal forest 6  studies have shown that vegetation seems to have a greater impact on the abundance of this bird than other factors like climate or patch size 7  winter et al 2005 says that it can be found at highest densities in areas with a “moderate amounts of bare ground” agriculture and drainage of these areas is currently the greatest threat to the le contes sparrow 8 behaviour edit vocalizations edit the male’s song resembles a grasshopper buzz with a short squeaky introductory note and ending with a short chirp 6  it is often described as tika zzzzzzzzzzzz tik while the call is a short tsip 5  8  it is most commonly confused with the song of the nelsons sparrow the male generally sings from a concealed location but can also be seen singing from the top of protruding grass stems or occasionally in flight 2 diet in the summer is mostly insects such as weevils leafhoppers leaf beetles stinkbugs caterpillars moths and spiders 9  during the winter time the main diet consists of seeds of grasses and weeds such as northern dropseed indian grass yellow foxtail panic grass scorpion grass little bluestem and big bluestem 9 reproduction edit mating can start as early as late april but peaks in mid may 6  males will sing from the cover of dense grasses perched on tall grass or in flight 2  clutches range from two to six eggs with four being the most common 2  incubation is done solely by the female though both parents aid in feeding 8  incubation lasts an average of 11–13 days 2  hatchlings are altricial with dull brown downy patches 3  10  pairs will have one or two broods per year 8  due to the secretive nature of this bird little is known about the period of time between hatching and fledging 10 nests are built by the female and are cup shaped made from fine grasses and lined with soft grass and hair 3  10  they are usually attached to standing grasses or sedges and are built on or close to the ground 2  10 eggs are 18 x 14 mm long and are sub elliptical in shape 10  eggs are white with undertones of green grey or blue covered in fine brown dots speckles or splotches usually clustered near large end of egg 10 interesting facts edit their nests are often parasitized by brown headed cowbirds 2 it is also known as le conte’s bunting 2 they were once known as “stink birds” because they were often chosen over quail by hunting dogs 5 they are much more commonly heard than seen one survey of le conte’s identified 86 males by sound but only 8 of those males by sight 5 very few le conte’s have ever been banded between 1967 and 1984 only 355 were actually banded and none were ever re captured 3 references edit  birdlife international 2012 ammodramus leconteii iucn red list of threatened species version 20132 international union for conservation of nature retrieved 26

savannah sparrow   wikipedia the savannah sparrow passerculus sandwichensis is a small american sparrow it is the only widely accepted member of the genus passerculus comparison of mtdna nadh dehydrogenase subunit 2 and 3 sequences indicates that the ipswich sparrow formerly usually considered a valid species as passerculus princeps is a well marked subspecies of the savannah sparrow whereas the southwestern large billed sparrow should be recognized as a distinct species passerculus rostratus 2 the common name comes from savannah georgia where one of the first specimens of this bird was collecteddistribution edit this passerine bird breeds in alaska canada northern central and pacific coastal united states mexico and guatemala the pacific and mexican breeders are resident but other populations are migratory wintering from the southern united states across central america and the caribbean to northern south america it is a very rare vagrant to western europe 3 description edit this species has a typically sparrow like dark streaked brown back and whitish underparts with brown or blackish breast and flank streaking it has whitish crown and supercilium stripes sometimes with some yellow more often near the beak the cheeks are brown and the throat white the flight feathers are blackish brown with light brown or white border the eyes are dark the feet and legs are horn colored as is the lower part of the bill with the upper part being dark grey 3 the savannah sparrow is a very variable species with numerous subspecies several of which have been split as separate species at various times the different forms vary principally in the darkness of the plumage the variation generally follows glogers rule with alaskan and interior races the palest and southwestern coastal forms the darkest there are some exceptions though most conspicuously in some island populations that presumably were strongly affected by founder effects the general pattern of variation has a fairly clear divide southwest of which the birds become notably darker this agrees quite well with the limit between p sandwichensis and p s rostratus 2  3  savannah sparrows show some variation in size across subspecies the total length can range from 11 to 17 cm 43 to 67 in wingspan ranges from 18 to 25 cm 71 to 98 in and body mass from 15 to 29 g 053 to 102 oz 4  5  in the nominate subspecies the body weight averages 201 g 071 oz 6 the savannah sparrows proper see below are very similar and migrant birds can not usually be related to a breeding population with certainty the resident or partially migratory subspecies are well distinguishable by size and particularly between groups coloration 3 behavior edit these birds forage on the ground or in low bushes particularly in winter they are also found in grazed low growth grassland they mainly eat seeds but also eat insects in the breeding season they are typically encountered as pairs or family groups in the breeding season and assemble in flocks for the winter migration the flight call is a thin seep 3  sensu lato the savannah sparrow is considered a threatened species by the iucn 1  3  7  the song is mixture of chirps and trillssystematics edit seventeen subspecies including the large billed sparrows are currently recognized though many are only described from wintering birds and much of the variation seems to be clinal four additional subspecies are no longer generally accepted the complex is usually divided into several groupssavannah sparrows proper edit probably p s anthinus alaska

utilize different habitat and their breeding season does not seem to coincide notes 1  with that of beldings sparrows however their bill size is due to convergent evolution and their habitat choice simply to the lack of alternatives on their barren island home altogether it appears to be a fairly recent offshoot from the beldings sparrows group it appears as distinct evolutionarily from these as

song sparrow   wikipedia the song sparrow melospiza melodia is a medium sized american sparrow among the native sparrows in north america it is easily one of the most abundant variable and adaptable speciesdescription edit adult song sparrows have brown upperparts with dark streaks on the back and are white underneath with dark streaking and a dark brown spot in the middle of the breast they have a brown cap and a long brown rounded tail their face is gray with a streak through the eye they are highly variable in size across numerous subspecies for subspecies details see below the body length ranges from 11 to 18 cm 43 to 71 in and wingspan can range from 18 to 254 cm 71 to 100 in 2  3  body mass ranges from 119 to 53 g 042 to 187 oz 4  the average of all races is 32 g 11 oz but the widespread nominate subspecies m m melodia weighs only about 22 g 078 oz on average the maximum lifespan in the wild is 113 years 5  the eggs of the song sparrow are brown with greenish white spots females lay three to five eggs per clutch with an average incubation time of 13–15 days before hatchingin the field they are most easily confused with the lincolns sparrow and the savannah sparrow the former can be recognized by its shorter grayer tail and the differently patterned head the brown cheeks forming a clear cut angular patch the savannah sparrow has a forked tail and yellowish flecks on the face when seen up closedistribution and life history edit though a habitat generalist the song sparrow favors brushland and marshes including salt marshes across most of canada and the united states they also thrive in human dominated areas such as in suburbs agricultural fields and along roadsides permanent residents of the southern half of their range northern populations of the song sparrow migrate to the southern united states or mexico during winter and intermingle with the native non migratory population the song sparrow is a very rare vagrant to western europe with a few recorded in great britain and norwaythese birds forage on the ground in shrubs or in very shallow water they mainly eat insects and seeds birds in salt marshes may also eat small crustaceans they nest either in a sheltered location on the ground or in trees or shrubsphysiology edit the song sparrow has been the subject of several studies detailing the physiological reactions of bird species to conditions such as daylight length and differing climatic conditions most birds gain mass in their reproductive organs in response to some signal either internal or external as the breeding season approaches the exact source of this signal varies from species to species   for some it is an endogenous process separate from environmental cues while other species require extensive external signals of changing daylight length and temperature before beginning to increase the mass of their reproductive organs male specimens of m melodia gain significant testicular mass in response both to changes in the daily photoperiod and as a result of endogenous chemical signals 6  females also undergo significant ovarian growth in response to both photo period and endogenous signals in this way m melodia is amongst only a handful of birds that use both external and engodenous signalling to dictate their breeding season hormone levels in both males and females were found fluctuate throughout the breeding season having very high levels in march and late april and then declining until may 7  these studies suggest that there are multiple factors at work that influence when and how the song sparrow breeds other than just increasing day lengthdue to the myriad subspecies of the song sparrow and the extremely varied climate of southern california where many of these subspecies make their homes physiological studies were undertaken to determine how climatic conditions and local environment influenced the bill size of m melodia subspecies the bill of a bird is highly important for thermoregulation as the bare surface area makes a perfect place to radiate excess heat or absorb solar energy to maintain homeostasis 8  knowing this comparisons of bill length between individual song sparrows collected in different habitats were made with regard to the primary habitat type or microclimate that they were collected in larger beaked subspecies were strongly correlated with hotter microclimates   a correlation that follows from the conditions of allens rule 9 the sparrow species derives it name from its colorful repertoire of songs enthusiasts report that one of the songs heard often in suburban locations closely resembles the opening four notes of ludwig van beethovens symphony no 5 the male uses a fairly complex song to declare ownership of its territory and attract femalessinging itself consists of a combination of repeated notes quickly passing isolated notes and trills the songs are very crisp clear and precise making them easily distinguishable by human ears a particular song is determined not only by pitch and rhythm but also by the timbre of the trills although one bird will know many songs—as many as 20 different tunes with as many as 1000 improvised variations on the basic theme citation needed —unlike thrushes the song sparrow usually repeats the same song many times before switching to a different songsong sparrows typically learn their songs from a handful of other birds that have neighboring territories they are most likely to learn songs that are shared in common between these neighbors ultimately they will choose a territory close to or replacing the birds that they have learned from this allows the song sparrows to address their neighbors with songs shared in common with those neighbors it has been demonstrated that song sparrows are able to distinguish neighbors from strangers on the basis of song and also that females are able to distinguish and prefer their mates songs from those of other neighboring birds and they prefer songs of neighboring birds to those of strangerspredators and parasites edit common predators of the song sparrow include cats hawks and owls however snakes dogs and the american kestrel are treated ambiguously suggesting that they are less of a threat the song sparrow recognizes enemies by both instinctual and learned patterns including cultural learning and adjusts its future behavior based on both its own experiences in encounters and from watching other birds interact with the enemies comparisons of experiments on hand raised birds to observation of birds in the wild suggest that the fear of owls and hawks is instinctual but fear of cats is learned 10 song sparrows nests are parasitized by the brown headed cowbird the cowbirds eggs closely resemble song sparrows eggs although the cowbirds eggs are slightly larger song sparrows recognize cowbirds as a threat and attack the cowbirds when they are near the nest there is some evidence that this behavior is learned rather than instinctual 10  a more recent study found that the behavior of attacking female cowbirds near nests may actually attract cowbird parasitism because the female cowbirds use such behavior to identify female song sparrows that are more likely to successfully raise a cowbird chick 11  one study found that while cowbird parasitism did result in more nest failure overall there were negligible effects on song sparrow populations when cowbirds were introduced to an island the study pointed to a number of explanatory factors including song sparrows raising multiple broods and song sparrows abilities to raise cowbird chicks with their own 12 subspecies edit the song sparrow is one of the birds with the most numerous subspecies in north america and even on a global scale rivals such species as the horned lark the yellow wagtail the golden whistler or the island thrush 52 subspecies were named altogether of which 24 are now considered valid 13  14  it is a cryptic specieseastern group edit small

eurasian tree sparrow   wikipedia the eurasian tree sparrow passer montanus is a passerine bird in the sparrow family with a rich chestnut crown and nape and a black patch on each pure white cheek the sexes are similarly plumaged and young birds are a duller version of the adult this sparrow breeds over most of temperate eurasia and southeast asia where it is known as the tree sparrow and it has been introduced elsewhere including the united states where it is known as the eurasian tree sparrow or german sparrow to differentiate it from the native unrelated american tree sparrow although several subspecies are recognised the appearance of this bird varies little across its extensive rangethe eurasian tree sparrows untidy nest is built in a natural cavity a hole in a building or the large nest of a european magpie or white stork the typical clutch is five or six eggs which hatch in under two weeks this sparrow feeds mainly on seeds but invertebrates are also consumed particularly during the breeding season as with other small birds infection by parasites and diseases and predation by birds of prey take their toll and the typical life span is about two yearsthe eurasian tree sparrow is widespread in the towns and cities of eastern asia but in europe it is a bird of lightly wooded open countryside with the house sparrow breeding in the more urban areas the eurasian tree sparrows extensive range and large population ensure that it is not endangered globally but there have been large declines in western european populations in part due to changes in farming practices involving increased use of herbicides and loss of winter stubble fields in eastern asia and western australia this species is sometimes viewed as a pest although it is also widely celebrated in oriental artdescription edit the eurasian tree sparrow is 125–14 cm 5–5 1⁄2 in long 2  with a wingspan of about 21 cm 83 in and a weight of 24 g 085 oz 3  making it roughly 10 smaller than the house sparrow 4  the adults crown and nape are rich chestnut and there is a kidney shaped black ear patch on each pure white cheek the chin throat and the area between the bill and throat are black the upperparts are light brown streaked with black and the brown wings have two distinct narrow white bars the legs are pale brown and the bill is lead blue in summer becoming almost black in winter 5 this sparrow is distinctive even within its genus in that it has no plumage differences between the sexes the juvenile also resembles the adult although the colours tend to be duller 6  its contrasting face pattern makes this species easily identifiable in all plumages 4  the smaller size and brown not grey crown are additional differences from the male house sparrow 2  adult and juvenile eurasian tree sparrows undergo a slow complete moult in the autumn and show an increase in body mass despite a reduction in stored fat the change in mass is due to an increase in blood volume to support active feather growth and a generally higher water content in the body 7 the eurasian tree sparrow has no true song but its vocalisations include an excited series of tschip calls given by unpaired or courting males other monosyllabic chirps are used in social contacts and the flight call is a harsh teck 4  a study comparing the vocalisations of the introduced missouri population with those of birds from germany showed that the us birds had fewer shared syllable types memes and more structure within the population than the european sparrows this may have resulted from the small size of the founding north american population and a consequent loss of genetic diversity 8 taxonomy edit description of the house and eurasian tree sparrows from the systema naturae 9 the old world sparrow genus passer is a group of small passerine birds that is believed to have originated in africa and which contains 15–25 species depending on the authority 10  its members are typically found in open lightly wooded habitats although several species notably the house sparrow p domesticus have adapted to human habitations most species in the genus are typically 10–20 cm 39–79 in long predominantly brown or greyish birds with short square tails and stubby conical beaks they are primarily ground feeding seed eaters although they also consume invertebrates especially when breeding 11  genetic studies show that the eurasian tree sparrow diverged from the other eurasian members of its genus relatively early before the speciation of the house plain backed and spanish sparrows 12  13  the eurasian species is not closely related to the american tree sparrow spizelloides arborea which is an american sparrow 14 the eurasian tree sparrows binomial name is derived from two latin words passer sparrow and montanus of the mountains from mons mountain 3  the eurasian tree sparrow was first described by carl linnaeus in his 1758 systema naturae as fringilla montana 15  but along with the house sparrow it was soon moved from the finches family fringillidae into the new genus passer created by french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson in 1760 16  the eurasian tree sparrows common name is given because of its preference of tree holes for nesting this name and the scientific name montanus do not appropriately describe this speciess habitat preferences the german name feldsperling field sparrow comes closer to doing so 17 subspecies edit subspecies of p m malaccensis in manado indonesiathis species varies little in appearance across its large range and the differences between the seven extant subspecies recognised by clement are slight at least 15 other subspecies have been proposed but are considered to be intermediates of the listed races 5  18 p m montanus the nominate subspecies ranges across europe except southwestern iberia southern greece and the former yugoslavia it also breeds in asia east to the lena river and south to the northern regions of turkey the caucasus kazakhstan mongolia and koreap m transcaucasicus described by sergei aleksandrovich buturlin in 1906 breeds from the southern caucasus east to northern iran it is duller and greyer than the nominate race 5 p m dilutus described by charles wallace richmond in 1856 is resident in the extreme northeast of iran northern pakistan and northwest india it also occurs further north from uzbekistan and tajikistan east to china compared to p m montanus it is paler with sandy brown upperparts 5 p m tibetanus the largest race by size was described by stuart baker in 1925 it is found in the northern himalayas from nepal east through tibet to northwest china it resembles p m dilutus but is darker 5 p m saturatus described by leonhard hess stejneger in 1885 breeds in sakhalin the kuril islands japan taiwan and south korea it is deeper brown than the nominate subspecies and has a larger bill 5 p m malaccensis described by alphonse dubois in 1885 is found from the southern himalayas east to hainan and indonesia it is a dark race like p m saturatus but is smaller and more heavily streaked on its upperparts 5 p m hepaticus described by sidney dillon ripley in 1948 breeds from northeast assam to northwest burma it is similar to p m saturatus but redder on its head and upperparts 5 distribution and habitat edit the eurasian tree sparrows natural breeding range comprises most of temperate europe and asia south of about latitude 68°n north of this the summers are too cold with july average temperatures below 12 °c and through southeast asia to java and bali it formerly bred in the faroes malta and gozo 4  5  in south asia it is found mainly in the temperate zone 19  20  it is sedentary over most of its extensive range but northernmost breeding populations migrate south for the winter 21  and small numbers leave southern europe for north africa and the middle east 4  the eastern subspecies p m dilutus reaches coastal pakistan in winter and thousands of birds of this race move through eastern china in autumn 5 the eurasian tree sparrow has been introduced outside its native range but has not always become established possibly due to competition with the house sparrow it was introduced successfully to sardinia eastern indonesia the philippines and micronesia but introductions to new zealand and bermuda did not take root ship carried birds colonised borneo this sparrow has occurred as a natural vagrant to gibraltar tunisia algeria egypt israel and dubai 5 in north america a population of about 15000 birds has become established around st louis and neighbouring parts of illinois and southeastern iowa 22  these sparrows are descended from 12 birds imported from germany and released in late april 1870 as part of a project to enhance the native north american avifauna within its limited us range the eurasian tree sparrow has to compete with the house sparrow in urban centres and is therefore mainly found in parks farms and rural woods 8  23  the american population is sometimes referred to as the german sparrow to distinguish it from both the native american tree sparrow species and the much more widespread english house sparrow 24 urban nest under a roof tile of a wooden house in japanin australia the eurasian tree sparrow is present in melbourne towns in central and northern victoria and some centres in the riverina region of new south wales it is a prohibited species in western australia where it often arrives on ships from southeast asia 25 despite its scientific name passer montanus this is not typically a mountain species and reaches only 700 m 2300 ft in switzerland although it has bred at 1700 m 5600 ft in the northern caucasus and as high as 4270 m 14010 ft in nepal 4  5  in europe it is frequently found on coasts with cliffs in empty buildings in pollarded willows along slow water courses or in open countryside with small isolated patches of woodland 4  the eurasian tree sparrow shows a strong preference for nest sites near wetland habitats and avoids breeding on intensively managed mixed farmland 26 when the eurasian tree sparrow and the larger house sparrow occur in the same area the house sparrow generally breeds in urban areas while the smaller eurasian tree sparrow nests in the countryside 5  where trees are in short supply as in mongolia both species may utilise man made structures as nest sites 27  the eurasian tree sparrow is rural in europe but is an urban bird in eastern asia in southern and central asia both passer species may be found around towns and villages 5  in parts of the mediterranean such as italy both the tree and the italian or spanish sparrows may be found in settlements 28  in australia the eurasian tree sparrow is largely an urban bird and it is the house sparrow which utilises more natural habitats 25 behaviour and ecology edit breeding edit the eurasian tree sparrow reaches breeding maturity within a year from hatching 29  and typically builds its nest in a cavity in an old tree or rock face some nests are not in holes as such but are built among roots of overhanging gorse or similar bush 30  roof cavities in houses may be used 30  and in the tropics the crown of a palm tree or the ceiling of a verandah can serve as a nest site 31  this species will breed in the disused domed nest of a european magpie 30  or an active or unused stick nest of a large bird such as the white stork 32  white tailed eagle osprey black kite or grey heron it will sometimes attempt to take over the nest of other birds that breed in holes or enclosed spaces such as the barn swallow house martin sand martin or european bee eater 33 pairs may breed in isolation or in loose colonies 34  and will readily use nest boxes in a spanish study boxes made from a mixture of wood and concrete woodcrete had a much higher occupancy rate than wooden boxes 765 versus 335 and birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches a shorter incubation period and more breeding attempts per season clutch size and chick condition did not differ between nest box types but reproductive success was higher in woodcrete perhaps because the synthetic nests were 15 °c warmer than their wooden counterparts 35 the male calls from near the nest site in spring to proclaim ownership and attract a mate he may also carry nest material into the nest hole 5  the display and nest building is repeated in autumn the preferred locations for the autumn display are old eurasian tree sparrow nests particularly those where nestlings had hatched empty nest boxes and sites used by house sparrows or other hole nesting birds such as tits pied flycatchers or common redstarts are rarely used for the autumn display 36 the untidy nest is composed of hay grass wool or other material and lined with feathers 30  which improve the thermal insulation 37  a complete nest consists of three layers base lining and dome 36  the typical clutch is five or six eggs rarely more than four in malaysia 31  white to pale grey and heavily marked with spots small blotches or speckling 38  they are 20 mm × 14 mm 079 in × 055 in in size and weigh 21 g 0074 oz of which 7 is shell 3  the eggs are incubated by both parents for 12–13 days before the altricial naked chicks hatch and a further 15–18 days elapse before they fledge two or three broods may be raised each year 3  birds breeding in colonies produce more eggs and fledglings from their first broods than solitary pairs but the reverse is true for second and third clutches 39  females which copulate frequently tend to lay more eggs and have a shorter incubation time so within pair mating may be an indicator of the pairs reproductive ability 40  there is a significant level of promiscuity in a hungarian study more than 9 of chicks were sired by extra pair males and 20 of the broods contained at least one extra pair young 41 hybridisation between the eurasian tree sparrow and the house sparrow has been recorded in many parts of the world with male hybrids tending to resemble the eurasian tree sparrow while females have more similarities with the house sparrow 42  a breeding population in the eastern ghats of india 43  said to be introduced 5  may also hybridise with house sparrows 20  on at least one occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young 44  45  46  a wild hybridisation with the resident sparrows of malta which are intermediate between the spanish sparrow p hispaniolensis and italian sparrows p italiae was recorded in malta in 1975 5 feeding edit the tree sparrow is a predominantly seed and grain eating bird which feeds on the ground in flocks often with house sparrows finches or buntings it eats weed seeds such as chickweeds and goosefoot spilled grain 5  and it may also visit feeding stations especially for peanuts it will also feed on invertebrates especially during the breeding season when the young are fed mainly on animal food it takes insects woodlice millipedes centipedes spiders and harvestmen 47 adults use a variety of wetlands when foraging for invertebrate prey to feed nestlings and aquatic sites play a key role in providing adequate diversity and availability of suitable invertebrate prey to allow successful chick rearing throughout the long breeding season of this multi brooded species large areas of formerly occupied farmland no longer provide these invertebrate resources due to the effects of intensive farming and the availability of supplementary seed food within 1 kilometre 062 mi of the nest site does not influence nest site choice or affect the number of young raised 26 in winter seed resources are most likely to be a key limiting factor 26  at this time of year individuals in a flock form linear dominance hierarchies but there is no strong relation between the size of the throat patch and position in that hierarchy this is in contrast to the house sparrow in that species fights to establish dominance are reduced by the display of the throat patch the size of which acts as a signalling badge of fitness 48 the risk of predation affects feeding strategies a study showed increased distance between shelter and a food supply meant that birds visited a feeder in smaller flocks spent less time on it and were more vigilant when far from shelter sparrows can feed as producers searching for food directly or scroungers just joining other flock members who have already discovered food scrounging was 30 more likely at exposed feeding sites although this is not due to increased anti predator vigilance a possible explanation is that riskier places are used by individuals with lower fat reserves 49 survival edit the sparrowhawk is a widespread predatorpredators of the tree sparrow include a variety of accipiters falcons and owls such as the eurasian sparrowhawk 47  common kestrel 50  little owl 51  52  and sometimes long eared owl and white stork 53  54  it does not appear to be at an increased risk of predation during its autumn moult despite having fewer flight feathers at that time 55  nests may be raided by eurasian magpies jays least weasels rats cats and constricting snakes such as the horseshoe whip snake 56  57  58 many species of birdlice are present on the birds and in their nests 59  60  and mites of the genus knemidocoptes have been known to infest populations resulting in lesions on the legs and toes 61  parasitisation of nestlings by protocalliphora blow fly larvae is a significant factor in nestling mortality 62  egg size does not influence nestling mortality but chicks from large eggs grow faster 63 tree sparrows are also subject to bacterial and viral infections bacteria have been shown to be an important factor in the failure of eggs to hatch and in nestling mortality 64  and mass deaths due to salmonella infection have been noted in japan 65  avian malaria parasites have been found in the blood of many populations 66  and birds in china were found to harbour a strain of h5n1 that was highly virulent to chickens 67 the immune response of tree sparrows is less robust than that of the house sparrow and has been proposed as a factor in the greater invasive potential of the latter 68  the house sparrow and tree sparrow are the most frequent victims of roadkill on the roads of central eastern and southern europe 69  the maximum recorded age is 131 years 29  but three years is a typical lifespan 3 winter stubble is a seasonal food resource 70 the tree sparrow has a large currently unquantified range its world population is also unknown but includes an estimated 52–96 million individuals in europe although population trends have not been evaluated the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the iucn red list that is declining more than 30 in ten years or three generations for these reasons the species conservation status is evaluated at the global level as being of least concern 1 although the tree sparrow has been expanding its range in fennoscandia and eastern europe populations have been declining in much of western europe 4  71  a trend reflected in other farmland birds such as the skylark corn bunting and northern lapwing from 1980 to 2003 common farmland bird numbers fell by 28 70  the collapse in populations seems to have been particularly severe in great britain where there was a 95 decline between 1970 and 1998 72  and ireland which had only 1000–1500 pairs in the late 1990s 4  73  in the british isles such declines may be due to natural fluctuations to which tree sparrows are known to be prone 28  breeding performance has improved substantially as population sizes have decreased suggesting that decreases in productivity were not responsible for the decline and that survival was the critical factor 74  the large decline in tree sparrow numbers is probably the result of agricultural intensification and specialisation particularly the increased use of herbicides and a trend towards autumn sown crops at the expense of spring sown crops that produce stubble fields in winter the change from mixed to specialised farming and the increased use of insecticides has reduced the amount of insect food available for nestlings 70 relationships with humans edit the tree sparrow is seen as a pest in some areas in australia it damages many cereal and fruit crops and spoils cereal crops animal feed and stored grain with its droppings quarantine rules prohibit the transport of this species into western australia 25 chairman mao zedong of china attempted in april 1958 to reduce crop damage by tree sparrows estimated at 45 kg 99 lb of grain per bird each year by mobilising three million people and many scarecrows to drive the birds to death by exhaustion although initially successful the great sparrow campaign had overlooked the numbers of locusts and other insect pests consumed by the birds and crop yields fell exacerbating a famine which led to the deaths of 30 million people between 1959 and 1961 22  75  the tree sparrows consumption of insects has led to its use in agriculture to control fruit tree pests and the common asparagus beetle crioceris aspergi 76 the tree sparrow has long been depicted in chinese and japanese art often on a plant spray or in a flying flock 75  and representations by oriental artists including hiroshige have featured on the postage stamps of antigua and barbuda central african republic china and the gambia more straightforward illustrations were used on the stamps of belarus belgium cambodia estonia and taiwan 77  the fluttering of the bird gave rise to a traditional japanese dance the suzume odori developed in sendai which was depicted by artists such as hokusai 78 in the philippines where it is one of several species referred to as maya and is sometimes specifically referred to as the mayang simbahan church maya or church sparrow the tree sparrow is the most common bird in the cities many urban filipinos confuse it with the former national bird of the philippines the black headed munia   also called a maya but specifically differentiated in folk taxa as the mayang pula red maya 79 references edit  a b

edit reproduction edit white throated sparrows breed in central canada and new england they nest either on the ground under shrubs or low in trees in deciduous or mixed forest areas and lay three to five brown marked blue or green white eggswintering and migration edit in winter it migrates to the southern and eastern united states it stays year round in the atlantic provinces of canada this bird is a rare vagrant to western europe alongside some other species such as the cardinal dark eyed junco song sparrow and chickadees this species ranks among the most abundant native birds during winter in eastern north america 7  despite a high level of conspecific rivalry within white throated sparrows this species is often dominated by other seed eating winter residents even those that are no larger than itself like the song sparrow and thus may endure high levels of predation while foraging since restricted to sub optimal sites at times by competition 8  not to mention numerous mammalian carnivores at least 10 avian predators often hunt them and they are among the most regular prey species for some smaller raptors ie the sharp shinned hawk and eastern screech owl 9  10 these birds forage on the ground under or near thickets or in low vegetation they mainly eat seeds insects and berries and are attracted to bird feederssong and calls edit song of the white throated sparrowthere are at least two distinct songs sung by this species one consists of an initial note followed by three or so repeated notes at an interval of about a major third above the second song consists of an initial note a second a whole step lower and a third note repeated two or three times about a minor third below that this second song is commonly described by use of mnemonics with the cadence of po or sam peabody peabody peabody or o oh sweet canada canada canada the rhythm is very regular and the timbre could be described as pinched these musical intervals are only approximate to a human ear the song often sounds out of tune the repeated note will often change in pitch very slightly contributing to this effectthe white throated sparrow also has at least two calls in addition to its song

sand martin   wikipedia the sand martin riparia riparia or european sand martin bank swallow in the americas and collared sand martin in south asia is a migratory passerine bird in the swallow family it has a wide range in summer embracing practically the whole of europe and the mediterranean countries part of northern asia and also north america it winters in eastern and southern africa south america and south asiataxonomy edit this species was first described by linnaeus in his systema naturae in 1758 and originally named hirundo riparia the description consisted of the simple h irundo  cinerea gula abdomineque albis—an ash grey swallow with white throat and belly—and the type locality was simply given as europa 2  the specific name means of the riverbank it is derived from the latin ripa riverbank 3 the pale martin of northern india and southeastern china is now usually split as a separate species riparia diluta it has paler grey brown upperparts and a less distinct breast band it winters in pakistan and southern india 4 description edit the 12 cm 47 in long sand martin is brown above white below with a narrow brown band on the breast the bill is black the legs brown the young have rufous tips to the coverts and margins to the secondariesits brown back white throat small size and quick jerky flight separate it at once from similar swallows such as the common house martin delichon urbicum the american cliff swallow petrochelidon pyrrhonota or other species of riparia only the banded martin r cincta of sub saharan africa is similar but the sand martin only occurs there in the northern winterthe sand martins twittering song is continuous when the birds are on the wing and becomes a conversational undertone after they have settled in the roost the harsh alarm is heard when a passing falcon crow or other suspected predator requires combined action to drive it awayecology edit linnaeus already remarked on this species breeding habits habitat in europae collibus arenosis abruptis foramine serpentino—it lives in europe in winding holes in sheer sandy hills it is generally found near larger bodies of water such as rivers lakes or even the ocean throughout the year 2  5 the sand martin appears on its breeding grounds as the first of its family starting towards the end of march just in advance of the barn swallow in northern ohio they arrive in numbers by mid april about 10 days earlier than they did 100 years ago 6  7  at first they flit over the larger bodies of water alone in search of early flies later parties accompany other swallow species but for a time varying according to weather the birds remain at these large waters and do not visit their nesting haunts the sand martin departs early at any rate from its more northerly haunts in august the gatherings at the nightly roost increase enormously though the advent and departure of passage birds causes great irregularity in numbers they are essentially gone from their breeding range by the end of septemberthe food consists of small insects mostly gnats and other flies whose early stages are aquaticthe sand martin is sociable in its nesting habits from a dozen to many hundred pairs will nest close together according to available space the nests are at the end of tunnels of from a few inches to three or four feet in length bored in sand or gravel the actual nest is a litter of straw and feathers in a chamber at the end of the burrow it soon becomes a hotbed of parasites four or five white eggs are laid about mid late may and a second brood is usual in all but the most northernly breeding sitesthis is not a rare bird and it is classified as a species of least concern by the iucn 1  it does have some local protections as certain populations have declined or face threats from

barn swallow   wikipedia the barn swallow hirundo rustica is the most widespread species of swallow in the world 2  it is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upperparts a long deeply forked tail and curved pointed wings it is found in europe asia africa and the americas 2  in anglophone europe it is just called the swallow in northern europe it is the only common species called a swallow rather than a martin 3 there are six subspecies of barn swallow which breed across the northern hemisphere four are strongly migratory and their wintering grounds cover much of the southern hemisphere as far south as central argentina the cape province of south africa and northern australia 2  its huge range means that the barn swallow is not endangered although there may be local population declines due to specific threatsthe barn swallow is a bird of open country that normally uses man made structures to breed and consequently has spread with human expansion it builds a cup nest from mud pellets in barns or similar structures and feeds on insects caught in flight 4  this species lives in close association with humans and its insect eating habits mean that it is tolerated by man this acceptance was reinforced in the past by superstitions regarding the bird and its nest there are frequent cultural references to the barn swallow in literary and religious works due to both its living in close proximity to humans and its annual migration 5  the barn swallow is the national bird of austria and estoniadescription edit reported range from ornithological observations confirms the heavy migration pattern     year round range     summer range     winter rangejuvenile new hampshire usthe adult male barn swallow of the nominate subspecies h r rustica is 17–19 cm 67–75 in long including 2–7 cm 079–276 in of elongated outer tail feathers it has a wingspan of 32–345 cm 126–136 in and weighs 16–22 g 056–078 oz it has steel blue upperparts and a rufous forehead chin and throat which are separated from the off white underparts by a broad dark blue breast band the outer tail feathers are elongated giving the distinctive deeply forked swallow tail there is a line of white spots across the outer end of the upper tail 4  the female is similar in appearance to the male but the tail streamers are shorter the blue of the upperparts and breast band is less glossy and the underparts paler the juvenile is browner and has a paler rufous face and whiter underparts it also lacks the long tail streamers of the adult 2 the song of the barn swallow is a cheerful warble often ending with su seer with the second note higher than the first but falling in pitch calls include witt or witt witt and a loud splee plink when excited or trying to chase intruders away from the nest 4  the alarm calls include a sharp siflitt for predators like cats and a flitt flitt for birds of prey like the hobby 6  this species is fairly quiet on the wintering grounds 7 the distinctive combination of a red face and blue breast band render the adult barn swallow easy to distinguish from the african hirundo species and from the welcome swallow hirundo neoxena with which its range overlaps in australasia 2  in africa the short tail streamers of the juvenile barn swallow invite confusion with juvenile red chested swallow hirundo lucida but the latter has a narrower breast band and more white in the tail 8 taxonomy edit the barn swallow was described by linnaeus in his systema naturae in 1758 as hirundo rustica characterised as h rectricibus exceptis duabus intermediis macula alba notatîs 9  hirundo is the latin word for swallow rusticus means of the country 10  this species is the only one of that genus to have a range extending into the americas with the majority of hirundo species being native to africa this genus of blue backed swallows is sometimes called the barn swallows 2  3 the oxford english dictionary dates the english common name barn swallow to 1851 11  though an earlier instance of the collocation in an english language context is in gilbert whites popular book the natural history of selborne originally published in 1789the swallow though called the chimney swallow by no means builds altogether in chimnies   sic  but often within barns and out houses against the rafters  in sweden she builds in barns and is called ladusvala the barn swallow 12 this suggests that the english name may be a calque on the swedish termthere are few taxonomic problems within the genus but the red chested swallow—a resident of west africa the congo basin and ethiopia—was formerly treated as a subspecies of barn swallow the red chested swallow is slightly smaller than its migratory relative has a narrower blue breast band and the adult has shorter tail streamers in flight it looks paler underneath than barn swallow 8 subspecies edit video clip of european barn swallow in lindisfarne englandsix subspecies of barn swallow are generally recognized in eastern asia a number of additional or alternative forms have been proposed including saturata by robert ridgway in 1883 13  kamtschatica by benedykt dybowski in 1883 14  ambigua by erwin stresemann 15  and mandschurica by wilhelm meise in 1934 13  given the uncertainties over the validity of these forms 14  16  this article follows the treatment of turner and rose 2 h r rustica the nominate european subspecies breeds in europe and asia as far north as the arctic circle south to north africa the middle east and sikkim and east to the yenisei river it migrates on a broad front to winter in africa arabia and the indian subcontinent 2  the barn swallows wintering in southern africa are from across eurasia to at least 91°e 17  and have been recorded as covering up to 11660 km 7250 mi on their annual migration 18 h r transitiva was described by ernst hartert in 1910 it breeds in the middle east from southern turkey to israel and is partially resident though some birds winter in east africa it has orange red underparts and a broken breast band 2 h r savignii the resident egyptian subspecies was described by james stephens in 1817 and named for french zoologist marie jules césar savigny 19  it resembles transitiva which also has orange red underparts but savignii has a complete broad breast band and deeper red hue to the underparts 6 h r gutturalis described by giovanni antonio scopoli in 1786 13  has whitish underparts and a broken breast band breast chestnut and lower underparts more pink buff 20  the populations that breed in the central and eastern himalayas have been included in this subspecies 21  although the primary breeding range is japan and korea the east asian breeders winter across tropical asia from india and sri lanka 22  east to indonesia and new guinea increasing numbers are wintering in australia it hybridises with h r tytleri in the amur river area it is thought that the two eastern asia forms were once geographically separate but the nest sites provided by expanding human habitation allowed the ranges to overlap 2  h r gutturalis is a vagrant to alaska and washington 23  but is easily distinguished from the north american breeding subspecies h r erythrogaster by the latters reddish underparts 2 h r tytleri first described by thomas jerdon in 1864 and named for british soldier naturalist and photographer robert christopher tytler 13  has deep orange red underparts and an incomplete breast band the tail is also longer 20  it breeds in central siberia south to northern mongolia and winters from eastern bengal east to thailand and malaysia 2 h r erythrogaster in washington state ush r erythrogaster the north american subspecies described by pieter boddaert in 1783 13  differs from the european subspecies in having redder underparts and a narrower often incomplete blue breast band it breeds throughout north america from alaska to southern mexico and migrates to the lesser antilles costa rica panama and south america to winter 7  a few may winter in the southernmost parts of the breeding range this subspecies funnels through central america on a narrow front and is therefore abundant on passage in the lowlands of both coasts 24 the short wings red belly and incomplete breast band of h r tytleri are also found in h r erythrogaster and dna analyses show that barn swallows from north america colonised the baikal region of siberia a dispersal direction opposite to that for most changes in distribution between north america and eurasia 25 behaviour edit habitat and range edit barn swallow in slow motionthe preferred habitat of the barn swallow is open country with low vegetation such as pasture meadows and farmland preferably with nearby water this swallow avoids heavily wooded or precipitous areas and densely built up locations the presence of accessible open structures such as barns stables or culverts to provide nesting sites and exposed locations such as wires roof ridges or bare branches for perching are also important in the birds selection of its breeding range 4 it breeds in the northern hemisphere from sea level to typically 2700 m 8900 ft 26  but to 3000 m 9800 ft in the caucasus 4  and north america 27  and it is absent only from deserts and the cold northernmost parts of the continents over much of its range it avoids towns and in europe is replaced in urban areas by the house martin however in honshū japan the barn swallow is a more urban bird with the red rumped swallow cecropis daurica replacing it as the rural species 2 in winter the barn swallow is cosmopolitan in its choice of habitat avoiding only dense forests and deserts 28  it is most common in open low vegetation habitats such as savanna and ranch land and in venezuela south africa and trinidad and tobago it is described as being particularly attracted to burnt or harvested sugarcane fields and the waste from the cane 7  29  30  in the absence of suitable roost sites they may sometimes roost on wires where they are more exposed to predators 31  individual birds tend to return to the same wintering locality each year 32  and congregate from a large area to roost in reed beds 29  these roosts can be extremely large one in nigeria had an estimated 15 million birds 33  these roosts are thought to be a protection from predators and the arrival of roosting birds is synchronised in order to overwhelm predators like african hobbies the barn swallow has been recorded as breeding in the more temperate parts of its winter range such as the mountains of thailand and in central argentina 2  34 migration of barn swallows between britain and south africa was first established on 23 december 1912 when a bird that had been ringed by james masefield at a nest in staffordshire was found in natal 35  as would be expected for a long distance migrant this bird has occurred as a vagrant to such distant areas as hawaii bermuda greenland tristan da cunha and the falkland islands 2 feeding edit chicks in the nest waiting to be fedthe barn swallow is similar in its habits to other aerial insectivores including other swallow species and the unrelated swifts it is not a particularly fast flier with a speed estimated at about 11 ms up to 20 ms and a wing beat rate of approximately 5 up to 7–9 times each second 36  37  but it has the manoeuvrability necessary to feed on flying insects while airborne it is often seen flying relatively low in open or semi open areasthe barn swallow typically feeds 7–8 m 23–26 ft above shallow water or the ground often following animals humans or farm machinery to catch disturbed insects but it will occasionally pick prey items from the water surface walls and plants in the breeding areas large flies make up around 70 of the diet with aphids also a significant component however in europe the barn swallow consumes fewer aphids than the house or sand martins 4  on the wintering grounds hymenoptera especially flying ants are important food items when egg laying barn swallows hunt in pairs but will form often large flocks otherwise 2 isotope studies have shown that wintering populations may utilise different feeding habitats with british breeders feeding mostly over grassland whereas swiss birds utilised woodland more 38  another study showed that a single population breeding in denmark actually wintered in two separate and different areas 39 the barn swallow drinks by skimming low over lakes or rivers and scooping up water with its open mouth 27  this bird bathes in a similar fashion dipping into the water for an instant while in flight 32 swallows gather in communal roosts after breeding sometimes thousands strong reed beds are regularly favoured with the birds swirling en masse before swooping low over the reeds 6  reed beds are an important source of food prior to and whilst on migration although the barn swallow is a diurnal migrant that can feed on the wing whilst it travels low over ground or water the reed beds enable fat deposits to be established or replenished 40 breeding edit the male barn swallow returns to the breeding grounds before the females and selects a nest site which is then advertised to females with a circling flight and song the breeding success of the male is related to the length of the tail streamers with longer streamers being more attractive to the female 4  41  males with longer tail feathers are generally longer lived and more disease resistant females thus gaining an indirect fitness benefit from this form of selection since longer tail feathers indicate a genetically stronger individual which will produce offspring with enhanced vitality 42  males in northern europe have longer tails than those further south whereas in spain the males tail streamers are only 5 longer than the females in finland the difference is 20 in denmark the average male tail length increased by 9 between 1984 and 2004 but it is possible that climatic changes may lead in the future to shorter tails if summers become hot and dry 43 males with long streamers also have larger white tail spots and since feather eating bird lice prefer white feathers large white tail spots without parasite damage again demonstrate breeding quality there is a positive association between spot size and the number of offspring produced each season 44 both sexes defend the nest but the male is particularly aggressive and territorial 2  once established pairs stay together to breed for life but extra pair copulation is common making this species genetically monogamous despite being socially polygamous 45  males guard females actively to avoid being cuckolded 46  males may use deceptive alarm calls to disrupt extrapair copulation attempts toward their mates 47 as its name implies the barn swallow typically nests inside accessible buildings such as barns and stables or under bridges and wharves the neat cup shaped nest is placed on a beam or against a suitable vertical projection it is constructed by both sexes although more often by the female with mud pellets collected in their beaks and lined with grasses feathers algae 48  or other soft materials 2  barn swallows may nest colonially where sufficient high quality nest sites are available and within a colony each pair defends a territory around the nest which for the european subspecies is 4 to 8 m2 43 to 86 sq ft in size colony size tends to be larger in north america 27 in north america at least barn swallows frequently engage in a mutualist relationship with ospreys barn swallows will build their nest below an osprey nest receiving protection from other birds of prey that are repelled by the exclusively fish eating ospreys the ospreys are alerted to the presence of these predators by the alarm calls of the swallows 27 before man made sites became common the barn swallow nested on cliff faces or in caves but this is now rare the female lays two to seven but typically four or five reddish spotted white eggs the eggs are 20 mm × 14 mm 079 in × 055 in in size and weigh 19 g 0067 oz of which 5 is shell in europe the female does almost all the incubation but in north america the male may incubate up to 25 of the time the incubation period is normally 14–19 days with another 18–23 days before the altricial chicks fledge the fledged young stay with and are fed by the parents for about a week after leaving the nest occasionally first year birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood 2 the barn swallow will mob intruders such as cats or accipiters that venture too close to their nest often flying very close to the threat 42  adult barn swallows have few predators but some are taken by accipiters falcons and owls brood parasitism by cowbirds in north america or cuckoos in eurasia is rare 4  27 there are normally two broods with the original nest being reused for the second brood and being repaired and reused in subsequent years hatching success is 90 and the fledging survival rate is 70–90 average mortality is 70–80 in the first year and 40–70 for the adult although the record age is more than 11 years most survive less than four years 2  barn swallow nestlings have prominent red gapes a feature shown to induce feeding by parent birds an experiment in manipulating brood size and immune system showed the vividness of the gape was positively correlated with t cell–mediated immunocompetence and that larger brood size and injection with an antigen led to a less vivid gape 49 the barn swallow has been recorded as hybridising with the cliff swallow petrochelidon pyrrhonota and the cave swallow p fulva in north america and the house martin delichon urbicum in eurasia the cross with the latter being one of the most common passerine hybrids 42 a chick less than an hour after being bornchicks and eggs in a nest with horse hair liningparasites and predators edit feeding trace of brueelia lice on the tail feather of a barn swallowbarn swallows and other small passerines often have characteristic feather holes on their wing and tail feathers these holes were suggested as being caused by avian lice such as machaerilaemus malleus and myrsidea rustica although other studies suggest that they are mainly caused by species of brueelia several other species of lice have been described from barn swallow hosts including brueelia domestica and philopterus microsomaticus 50  51  in texas the swallow bug oeciacus vicarius which is common on species such as the cliff swallow is also known to infest barn swallows 52 predatory bats such as the greater false vampire bat are known to prey on barn swallows 53  swallows at their communal roosts attract predators and several falcon species make use of these opportunities falcon species confirmed as predators include the peregrine falcon 54  and the african hobby 33 the barn swallow has an enormous range with an estimated global extent of 51700000 km2 20000000 sq mi and a population of 190 million individuals the species is evaluated as least concern on the 2007 iucn red list 1  and has no special status under the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites which regulates international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants 27 this is a species that has greatly benefited historically from forest clearance which has created the open habitats it prefers and from human habitation which have given it an abundance of safe man made nest sites there have been local declines due to the use of ddt in israel in the 1950s competition for nest sites with house sparrows in the us in the 19th century and an ongoing gradual decline in numbers in parts of europe and asia due to agricultural intensification reducing the availability of insect food however there has been an increase in the population in north america during the 20th century with the greater availability of nesting sites and subsequent range expansion including the colonisation of northern alberta 2 a specific threat to wintering birds from the european populations is the transformation by the south african government of a light aircraft runway near durban into an international airport for the 2010 fifa world cup the roughly 250 m 270 yd square mount moreland reed bed is a night roost for more than three million barn swallows which represent 1 of the global population and 8 of the european breeding population the reed bed lies on the flight path of aircraft using the proposed la mercy airport and there were fears that it would be cleared because the birds could threaten aircraft safety 55  56  however following detailed evaluation advanced radar technology will be installed to enable planes using the airport to be warned of bird movements and if necessary take appropriate measures to avoid the flocks 29 climate change may affect the barn swallow drought causes weight loss and slow feather regrowth and the expansion of the sahara will make it a more formidable obstacle for migrating european birds hot dry summers will reduce the availability of insect food for chicks conversely warmer springs may lengthen the breeding season and result in more chicks and the opportunity to use nest sites outside buildings in the north of the range might also lead to more offspring 43 relationship with humans edit the barn swallow is an attractive bird that feeds on flying insects and has therefore been tolerated by humans when it shares their buildings for nesting as one of the earlier migrants this conspicuous species is also seen as an early sign of summers approach 57 in the old world the barn swallow appears to have used man made structures and bridges since time immemorial an early reference is in virgils georgics 29 bc ante garrula quam tignis nidum suspendat hirundo before the twittering swallow hangs its nest from the rafters 58 many cattle farmers believed that swallows spread salmonella infections however a study in sweden showed no evidence of the birds being reservoirs of the bacteria 59 in literature edit many literary references are based on the barn swallows northward migration as a symbol of spring or summer the proverb about the necessity for more than one piece of evidence goes back at least to aristotles nicomachean ethics for as one swallow or one day does not make a spring so one day or a short time does not make a fortunate or happy man 57 the barn swallow symbolizes the coming of spring and thus love in the pervigilium veneris a late latin poem in the waste land t s eliot quoted the line quando fiam uti chelidon  ut tacere desinam  when will i be like the swallow so that i can stop being silent this refers to a version of the myth of philomela in which she turns into a nightingale and her sister procne into a swallow in less familiar versions the two species are reversed 60  on the other hand an image of the assembly of swallows for their southward migration concludes john keatss ode to autumnthe swallow is also notably cited in several of william shakespeares plays for the swiftness of its flight for example true hope is swift and flies with swallows wings from act 5 of richard iii and i have horse will follow where the game makes way and run like swallows oer the plain from the second act of titus andronicus shakespeare also references the annual migration of the species poetically in the winters tale act 4 daffodils that come before the swallow dares and take the winds of march with beautyin culture edit gilbert white studied the barn swallow in detail in his pioneering work the natural history of selborne but even this careful observer was uncertain whether it migrated or hibernated in winter 12  elsewhere its long journeys have been well observed and a swallow tattoo is popular amongst nautical men as a symbol of a safe return the tradition was that a mariner had a tattoo of this fellow wanderer after sailing 5000 nmi 9300 km 5800 mi a second swallow would be added after 10000 nmi 19000 km 12000 mi at sea 61  in the past the tolerance for this beneficial insectivore was reinforced by superstitions regarding damage to the barn swallows nest such an act might lead to cows giving bloody milk or no milk at all or to hens ceasing to lay 5  this may be a factor in the longevity of swallows nests survival with suitable annual refurbishment for 10–15 years is regular and one nest was reported to have been occupied for 48 years 5 it is depicted as the martlet merlette or merlot in heraldry where it represents younger sons who have no lands it is also represented as lacking feet as this was a common belief at the time 62  as a result of a campaign by ornithologists the barn swallow has been the national bird of estonia since 23 june 1960 63  64 see also edit references edit  a b birdlife international 2012 hirundo rustica iucn red list of

scarlet tanager   wikipedia the scarlet tanager piranga olivacea is a medium sized american songbird until recently placed in the tanager family thraupidae it and other members of its genus are now classified as belonging the cardinal family cardinalidae 2  the species plumage and vocalizations are similar to other members of the cardinal family although the piranga species lacks the thick conical bill well suited to seed and insect eating that many cardinals possessetymology edit the genus name piranga is from tupi tijepiranga the name for an unknown small bird and the specific olivacea is from new latin olivaceus olive green 3 description edit the scarlet tanager a mid sized passerine is marginally the smallest of the four species of piranga that breed north of the mexican border it can weigh from 235 to 38 g 083 to 134 oz with an average of 25 g 088 oz during breeding and an average of 35 g 12 oz at the beginning of migration scarlet tanagers can range in length from 16 to 19 cm 63 to 75 in in length and from 25 to 30 cm 98 to 118 in in wingspan 4  adults of both sexes have pale horn colored fairly stout and smooth textured bills adult males are crimson red with black wings and tail the males coloration is intense and deeply red similar but deeper in shade than the males of two occasionally co existing relatives the northern cardinal and the summer tanager both which lack black wings females are yellowish on the underparts and olive on top with yellow olive toned wings and tail the adult males winter plumage is similar to the females but the wings and tail remain darker young males briefly show a more complex variegated plumage intermediate between adult males and femalesthe somewhat confusing specific epithet olivacea the olive colored one was based on a female or immature specimen rather than erythromelas the red and black one which authors attempted to ascribe to the species throughout the 19th century older scientific names always takes precedence howeverfemale immature and non breeding males may be distinguished from the same ages and sexes in summer tanagers which are more brownish overall and western tanagers which always have bold white bars and more yellowish undersides than scarlet tanagers the song of the scarlet tanager sounds somewhat like a hoarser version of the american robins and is only slightly dissimilar from the songs of the summer and western tanagers the call of the scarlet tanager is an immediately distinctive chip burr or chip churr which is very different from the pit i tuck of the summer tanager and the softer rolled pri tic or prit i tic of western tanager 5 behavior edit scarlet tanagers eat ripe fruit when available occasionally including ones such as this orange half that are set out by humanstheir breeding habitat is large stretches of deciduous forest especially with oaks across eastern north america they can occur with varying degrees of success in young successional woodlands and occasionally in extensive plantings of shade trees in suburban areas parks and cemeteries for a viable breeding population at least 10 to 12 hectares of forest are required 6  7  in winter scarlet tanagers occur in the montane forest of the andean foothills scarlet tanagers migrate to northwestern south america passing through central america around april and again around october 8  they begin arriving in the breeding grounds in numbers by about may and already start to move south again in mid summer by early october they are all on their way south 9  10  the bird is an extremely rare vagrant to western europecall of the scarlet tanagerscarlet tanagers are often out of sight foraging high in trees sometimes flying out to catch insects in flight and then returning to the same general perch in a hunting style known as sallying sometimes however they will also capture their prey on the forest floor they eat mainly insects and will opportunistically consume fruit when plentiful any flying variety of insect will readily be taken when common such as bees wasps hornets ants and sawflies moths and butterflies beetles flies cicadas leafhoppers spittlebugs treehoppers plant lice and scale insects termites grasshoppers and locusts dragonflies and dobsonflies scarlet tanagers also takes snails earthworms and spiders while summer tanagers are famous for this feeding method when capturing bees wasps and hornets scarlet tanagers also rake the prey against a branch in order to remove their stingers before consumption 11  plant components of their diet consists of a wide variety of fruits that eaten mainly when insects are at population lows including blackberries rubus allegheniensis raspberries r ideaus huckleberries gaylussacia sp juneberries and serviceberries amelanchier spp mulberries morus rubra strawberries fragaria virginiana and chokeberries aronia melanocarpa 12  13 breeding edit male scarlet tanagers reach their breeding ground from mid may to early june females generally arrive several days to a week later nest building and egg laying both occur usually in less than two weeks after the adults arrivals the clutch is usually four eggs occasionally from three to five and exceptionally from one to six eggs may be laid the eggs are a light blue color often with a slight greenish or whitish tinge incubation lasts for 11 to 14 days hatching and fledging are both reached at different points in summer depending on how far north the tanagers are breeding from june early july in the southern parts of its breeding range to as late as august or even early september in the northernmost part of its range 5  the average weight at hatching is 397 g 0140 oz with the nestlings increasing their weight to 20–22 g 071–078 oz by 10 days or 70 of the parents weight the young leave the nest by 9–12 days of age and fly capably by the time they are a couple weeks old if the nesting attempt is disturbed apparently scarlet tanagers are unable to attempt a second brood as several other passerines can in a study of 16 nests in michigan 50 of nests were successful in producing one or more fledglings 14  in western new york fledgling success increased from 22 in scattered patches of woods to as much as 64 in extensive undisturbed hardwood forest 7 threats and status edit exposure and starvation can occasionally kill scarlet tanagers especially when exceptionally cold or wet weather hits eastern north america they often die from collisions with man made objects including tv and radio towers buildings and cars 15  beyond failure due to brown headed cowbirds molothrus ater see below predation is the primary direct cause of nesting failures in one study 69 78 of nests were predated 16  recorded nest predators are primarily avian like blue jays cyanocitta cristata common grackles quiscalus quiscula and american crows corvus brachyrhynchos although others like squirrels chipmunks raccoons procyon lotor and snakes probably take a heavy toll as well as an occasional unlucky fledgling as do cats felis catus raptorial birds hunt and kill many scarlet tanagers from fledgling throughout their adult lives including all three north american accipiter species merlins falco columbarius eastern screech owls megascops asio barred owls strix varia long eared owls asio otus and short eared owls asio flammeus 5  17  18 these birds do best in the forest interior where they are less exposed to predators and brood parasitism by the brown headed cowbird the cowbird lays its eggs in most any other passerines nest and the young often outcompete the young of the host bird and may cause failure and starvation some birds have evolved strategies to deal with cowbird parasitism but the scarlet tanager being a bird that evolved to breed in forest interior and not previously exposed to this are helpless victims to brood parasitism where forest fragmentation occurs which is quite widespread the scarlet tanager suffers high rates of predation and brood parasitism in small forest plots and are often absent completely from plots less than a minimum size their nests are typically built on horizontal tree branches specifically their numbers are declining in some areas due to habitat fragmentation but on a global scale tanagers are a plentiful species thus the iucn classifies the scarlet tanager as being of least

summer tanager   wikipedia the summer tanager piranga rubra is a medium sized american songbird formerly placed in the tanager family thraupidae it and other members of its genus are now classified in the cardinal family cardinalidae 2  the speciess plumage and vocalizations are similar to other members of the cardinal familythe genus name piranga is from tupi tijepiranga the name for an unknown small bird and the specific rubra is from latin ruber red 3 their breeding habitat is open wooded areas especially with oaks across the southern united states extending as far north as iowa these birds migrate to mexico central america and northern south america this tanager is an extremely rare vagrant to western europeadults have stout pointed bills and measure 17 cm 67 in in length and 29 g 10 oz in weight 4  5  adult males are rose red and similar in appearance to the hepatic tanager although the latter has a dark bill females are orangish on the underparts and olive on top with olive brown wings and tail as with all other birds all red and orange colorations are acquired through their dietthese birds are often out of sight foraging high in trees sometimes flying out to catch insects in flight they mainly eat insects especially bees and wasps and berries fruit of cymbopetalum mayanum annonaceae are an especially well liked food in their winter quarters and birds will forage in human altered habitat 6  consequently these trees can be planted to entice them to residential areas and they may well be attracted to bird feeders summer tanagers build a cup nest on a horizontal tree branchsummer tanager in birds of americathe summer tanager has an american robin like song similar enough that novices sometimes mistake this bird for that species the song consists of melodic units repeated in a constant stream the summer tanagers song however is much more monotonous than that of t migratorius often consisting of as few as three or four distinct units it is clearer and less nasal than the song of the scarlet tanagerthe summer tanager also has a sharp agitated sounded call pi tuk or pik i tuk i tuk 7 references edit  birdlife international 2012 piranga rubra iucn red list of threatened species version 20132 international union for conservation of nature retrieved 26 november 2013   remsen jv jr cd cadena a jaramillo m nores jf pacheco mb robbins ts schulenberg fg stiles df stotz and kj zimmer 2009 04 02  a classification of the bird species of south america american ornithologists union jobling james a 2010 the helm dictionary of scientific bird names london united kingdom christopher helm pp 308 340 isbn 978 1 4081 2501 4   1  crc handbook of avian body masses 1992 by john b dunning jr editor crc press isbn 978 0 8493 4258 5 foster mercedes s 2007 the potential of fruiting trees to enhance converted habitats for migrating birds in southern mexico bird conservation international 171 45 61 doi101017s0959270906000554 pdf fulltext peterson roger tory amp peterson virginia marie 2002 field guide to the birds of eastern and central north america 5th ed houghton mifflin boston isbn 0 395 74046 0external links edit 
arctic tern   wikipedia the arctic tern sterna paradisaea is a seabird of the tern family sternidae this bird has a circumpolar breeding distribution covering the arctic and sub arctic regions of europe asia and north america as far south as brittany and massachusetts the species is strongly migratory seeing two summers each year as it migrates along a convoluted route from its northern breeding grounds to the antarctic coast for the southern summer and back again about six months later recent studies have shown average annual roundtrip lengths of about 70900 km 44100 mi for birds nesting in iceland and greenland 3  and c 90000 km 56000 mi for birds nesting in the netherlands 4  these are by far the longest migrations known in the animal kingdom the arctic tern flies as well as glides through the air it nests once every one to three years depending on its mating cycle once it has finished nesting it takes to the sky for another long southern migrationarctic terns are medium sized birds they have a length of 28–39 cm 11–15 in and a wingspan of 65–75 cm 26–30 in 5  they are mainly grey and white plumaged with a redorangish beak and feet white forehead a black nape and crown streaked white and white cheeks the grey mantle is 305 mm and the scapulae are fringed brown some tipped white the upper wing is grey with a white leading edge and the collar is completely white as is the rump the deeply forked tail is whitish with grey outer websarctic terns are long lived birds with many reaching fifteen to thirty years of age they eat mainly fish and small marine invertebrates the species is abundant with an estimated one million individuals while the trend in the number of individuals in the species as a whole is not known exploitation in the past has reduced this birds numbers in the southern reaches of its rangethe arctic tern was known as sea swallow describing their slender shape as they swoop over the wateretymology edit the genus name sterna is derived from old english stearn tern 6  the specific paradisaea is from late latin paradisus paradise 7  the scots names picktarnie 8  tarrock 9  and their many variants are also believed to be onomatopoeic derived from the distinctive call 10  due to the difficulty in distinguishing the two species all the informal common names are shared with the common tern 11 distribution and migration edit the arctic tern has a continuous worldwide circumpolar breeding distribution there are no recognized subspecies it can be found in coastal regions in cooler temperate parts of north america and eurasia during the northern summer while wintering during the southern summer it can be found at sea reaching the northern edge of the antarctic ice 12 the arctic tern is famous for its migration it flies from its arctic breeding grounds to the antarctic and back again each year the shortest distance between these areas being 19000 km 12000 mi the long journey ensures that this bird sees two summers per year and more daylight than any other creature on the planet 13  one example of this birds remarkable long distance flying abilities involves an arctic tern ringed as an unfledged chick on the farne islands northumberland uk in the northern summer of 1982 which in october 1982 just three months from fledging reached melbourne australia assuming a direct route of flight the distance covered would have been more than 22000 km 14000 mi 14  another example is that of a chick ringed in labrador canada on 23 july 1928 it was found in south africa four months later 15 a 2010 study using tracking devices attached to the birds showed that the above examples are not unusual for the species in fact it turned out previous research had seriously underestimated the annual distances travelled by the arctic tern eleven birds that bred in greenland or iceland covered 70900 km 44100 mi on average in a year with a maximum of 81600 km 50700 mi the difference from previous estimates is due to the birds taking meandering courses rather than following a straight route as was previously assumed the birds follow a somewhat convoluted course in order to take advantage of prevailing winds 3  the average arctic tern lives about thirty years and will based on the above research travel some 24 million km 15 million mi during its lifetime the equivalent of a roundtrip from earth to the moon over 3 times 16 a 2013 tracking study of half a dozen arctic terns breeding in the netherlands 4  shows average annual migrations of c 90000 km 56000 mi on their way south these birds roughly followed the coastlines of europe and africa 17  having rounded the southern tip of africa they then turned east some flying approximately halfway to australia before again turning south to eventually reach wilkes land in the north eastern antarctic one bird flew several hundred kilometres along the south coast of australia before turning south for the antarctic while one flew along the entire south coast of australia passing between australia and tasmania having reached the melbourne area it turned south and flew in an arc to wilkes land in the north east antarctic passing the south western tip of new zealands south island en route once back in the netherlands this bird had journeyed c 91000 km 57000 mi the longest migration yet recorded for any animalarctic terns usually migrate sufficiently far offshore that they are rarely seen from land outside the breeding season 18 description and taxonomy edit the arctic tern is a medium sized bird around 33–36 cm 13–14 in from the tip of its beak to the tip of its tail the wingspan is 76–85 cm 30–33 in 18  the weight is 86–127 g 30–45 oz the beak is dark red as are the short legs and webbed feet like most terns the arctic tern has high aspect ratio wings and a tail with a deep fork 18 the adult plumage is grey above with a black nape and crown and white cheeks the upperwings are pale grey with the area near the wingtip being translucent the tail is white and the underparts pale grey both sexes are similar in appearance the winter plumage is similar but the crown is whiter and the bills are darker 18 an arctic tern in flight with wings spreadjuveniles differ from adults in their black bill and legs scaly appearing wings and mantle with dark feather tips dark carpal wing bar and short tail streamers 18  during their first summer juveniles also have a whiter forecrown 19 the species has a variety of calls the two most common being the alarm call made when possible predators such as humans or other mammals enter the colonies and the advertising call 20  the advertising call is social in nature made when returning to the colony and during aggressive encounters between individuals it is unique to each individual tern and as such it serves a similar role to the bird song of passerines identifying individuals eight other calls have been described from begging calls made by females during mating to attack calls made while swooping at intruderswhile the arctic tern is similar to the common and roseate terns its colouring profile and call are slightly different compared to the common tern it has a longer tail and mono coloured bill while the main differences from the roseate are its slightly darker colour and longer wings the arctic terns call is more nasal and rasping than that of the common and is easily distinguishable from that of the roseate 21 this birds closest relatives are a group of south polar species the south american sterna hirundinacea kerguelen s virgata and antarctic s vittata terns 22  on the wintering grounds the arctic tern can be distinguished from these relatives the six month difference in moult is the best clue here with arctic terns being in winter plumage during the southern summer the southern species also do not show darker wingtips in flightthe immature plumages of arctic tern were originally described as separate species sterna portlandica and sterna pikei 23 reproduction edit a nesting arctic tern with an egg in schleswig holstein germanyarctic terns flock on patagoniabreeding begins around the third or fourth year 24  arctic terns mate for life and in most cases return to the same colony each year 25  courtship is elaborate especially in birds nesting for the first time 26  courtship begins with a so called high flight where a female will chase the male to a high altitude and then slowly descend this display is followed by fish flights where the male will offer fish to the female courtship on the ground involves strutting with a raised tail and lowered wings after this both birds will usually fly and circle each other 26 an arctic tern chick on the farne islands northumberland englandboth sexes agree on a site for a nest and both will defend the site during this time the male continues to feed the female mating occurs shortly after this 26  breeding takes place in colonies on coasts islands and occasionally inland on tundra near water it often forms mixed flocks with the common tern it lays from one to three eggs per clutch most often two 18 an arctic tern protecting nest on amsterdam island svalbardit is one of the most aggressive terns fiercely defensive of its nest and young it will attack humans and large predators usually striking the top or back of the head although it is too small to cause serious injury to an animal of a humans size it is still capable of drawing blood and is capable of repelling many raptorial birds and smaller mammalian predators such as foxes and cats 13  other nesting birds such as alcids often incidentally benefit from the protection provided by nesting in an area defended by arctic ternsarctic tern nest with two eggs at thingvellir national park icelandthe nest is usually a depression in the ground which may or may not be lined with bits of grass or similar materials the eggs are mottled and camouflaged 18  both sexes share incubation duties the young hatch after 22–27 days and fledge after 21–24 days 18  if the parents are disturbed and flush from the nest frequently the incubation period could be extended to as long as 34 days 20 when hatched the chicks are downy neither altricial nor precocial the chicks begin to move around and explore their surroundings within one to three days after hatching 27  usually they do not stray far from the nest chicks are brooded by the adults for the first ten days after hatching 28  both parents care for hatchlings 18  chick diets always include fish and parents selectively bring larger prey items to chicks than they eat themselves 20  males bring more food than females feeding by the parents lasts for roughly a month before being weaned off slowly 18  after fledging the juveniles learn to feed themselves including the difficult method of plunge diving 29  they will fly south to winter with the help of their parents 30 arctic terns are long lived birds that spend considerable time raising only a few young and are thus said to be k selected 31  the bird has life span that was thought be around 20 years however national geographic the university of alberta amp massachusetts institute of technology concluded in 2010 that more than 50 of the species will live past their 30th birthday a study in the farne islands estimated an annual survival rate of 82 32 ecology and behaviour edit the diet of the arctic tern varies depending on location and time but is usually carnivorous in most cases it eats small fish or marine crustaceans 12  18  fish species comprise the most important part of the diet and account for more of the biomass consumed than any other food prey species are immature 1–2 year old shoaling species such as herring cod sandlances and capelin 13  among the marine crustaceans eaten are amphipods crabs and krill sometimes these birds also eat molluscs marine worms or berries and on their northern breeding grounds insects 27 arctic terns sometimes dip down to the surface of the water to catch prey close to the surface they may also chase insects in the air when breeding 27  it is also thought that arctic terns may in spite of their small size occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches 27  several species are targeted—conspecifics other terns like the common tern and some auk and grebe species 20 while nesting arctic terns are vulnerable to predation by cats and other animals 12  besides being a competitor for nesting sites the larger herring gull steals eggs and hatchlings camouflaged eggs help prevent this as do isolated nesting sites 29  while feeding skuas gulls and other tern species will often harass the birds and steal their food 33  they often form mixed colonies with other terns such as common and sandwich ternsconservation status edit arctic terns are considered threatened or a species of concern in certain states they are also among the species to which the agreement on the conservation of african eurasian migratory waterbirds applies 34  the species reduced population in new england in the late nineteenth century because of hunting for the millinery trade 20  exploitation continues today in western greenland where the population of the species has been reduced greatly since 1950 35 at the southern part of their range the arctic tern has been reducing in numbers much of this is due to lack of food 19  however most of these birds range is extremely remote with no apparent trend in the species as a whole 27 birdlife international has considered the species to be at lower risk since 1988 believing that there are approximately one million individuals around the world 2 cultural depictions edit the arctic tern has appeared on the postage stamps of several countries and dependent territories the territories include the åland islands alderney and faroe islands countries include canada finland iceland and cuba 36

black tern   wikipedia the black tern chlidonias niger or chlidonias nigra is a small tern generally found in or near inland water in europe and north america as its name suggests it has predominantly dark plumage in some lights it can appear blue in the breeding season hence the old english name blue darr citation needed  the genus name is from ancient greek khelidonios swallow like from khelidon swallow the species name is from latin niger shining black 2 description edit adults are 25 cm 98 in long with a wingspan 61 cm 24 in and weigh 62 g 22 oz they have short dark legs and a short weak looking black bill measuring 27 mm 11 in nearly as long as the head the bill is long slender and looks slightly decurved they have a dark grey back with a white forewing black head neck occasionally suffused with grey in the adult and belly black or blackish brown cap which unites in color with the ear coverts forming an almost complete hood and a light brownish grey square tail the face is white there is a big dark triangular patch in front of the eye and a broadish white collar in juveniles there are greyish brown smudges on the ides of the white breast a downwards extension of the plumage of the upperparts these marks vary in size and are not conspicuous in non breeding plumage most of the black apart from the cap is replaced by grey the plumage of the upperparts is drab with pale feather edgings the rump is brownish greythe north american race c n surinamensis is distinguishable from the european form in all plumages and is considered by some to be a separate speciesin flight the build appears slim the wing beats are full and dynamic and flight is often erratic as it dives to the surface for food similar to other tern speciesits call has been described as a high pitched kik the sound of a large flock has been called deafeninghybridisation with white winged black tern edit hybridisation between this species and white winged black tern has been recorded from sweden 3  and the netherlands 4  two juvenile birds at chew valley lake england in september 1978 and september 1981 were also believed to be hybrids they showed mixed characters of the two species specifically a combination of a dark mantle a feature of white winged black with dark patches on the breast side a feature of black tern not shown by white winted black 5  6 distribution and habitat edit their breeding habitat is freshwater marshes across most of canada the northern united states and much of europe and western asia they usually nest either on floating material in a marsh or on the ground very close to water laying 2–4 eggsin england the black tern was abundant in the eastern fens especially in lincolnshire and cambridgeshire until the early nineteenth century the english naturalist thomas pennant in 1769 referred to vast flocks of black terns whose calls are almost deafening extensive drainage of its breeding grounds wiped out the english population by about 1840 intermittent attempts by the species to recolonise england have proved unsuccessful with only a handful of english breeding records and one in ireland in the second half of the twentieth centurynorth american black terns migrate to the coasts of northern south america some to the open ocean old world birds winter in africaunlike the white sterna terns these birds do not dive for fish but forage on the wing picking up items at or near the waters surface or catching insects in flight they mainly eat insects and fish as well as amphibiansvagrancy edit the american race has occurred as a vagrant in britain

caspian tern   wikipedia the caspian tern hydroprogne caspia formerly sterna caspia 2  is a species of tern with a subcosmopolitan but scattered distribution despite its extensive range it is monotypic of its genus and has no accepted subspecies 3  the genus name is from ancient greek hudros water and latin progne swallow the specific caspia is from latin and like the english name refers to the caspian sea 4 description edit it is the worlds largest tern with a length of 48–60 cm 19–24 in a wingspan of 127–145 cm 50–57 in and a weight of 530–782 g 187–276 oz 3  5  adult birds have black legs and a long thick red orange bill with a small black tip they have a white head with a black cap and white neck belly and tail the upper wings and back are pale grey the underwings are pale with dark primary feathers in flight the tail is less forked than other terns and wing tips black on the underside 3  in winter the black cap is still present unlike many other terns but with some white streaking on the forehead the call is a loud heron like croak 6 distribution and habitat edit their breeding habitat is large lakes and ocean coasts in north america including the great lakes and locally in europe mainly around the baltic sea and black sea asia africa and australasia australia and new zealand north american birds migrate to southern coasts the west indies and northernmost south america european and asian birds spend the non breeding season in the old world tropics african and australasian birds are resident or disperse over short distances 3 in 2016 a nest of the caspian tern was found in the cape krusenstern national monument in northwestern alaska 1000 miles further north than any previous sighting this development was part of a general trend in alaska of species moving to the north a tendency ascribed to global warming 7 the global population is about 50000 pairs numbers in most regions are stable but the baltic sea population 1400–1475 pairs in the early 1990s is declining and of conservation concern 3  8 the caspian tern is one of the species to which the agreement on the conservation of african eurasian migratory waterbirds aewa appliesbehaviour edit feeding edit they feed mainly on fish which they dive for hovering high over the water and then plunging they also occasionally eat large insects the young and eggs of other birds and rodents they may fly up to 60 km 37 mi from the breeding colony to catch fish they often fish on freshwater lakes as well as at sea 3  6 breeding edit breeding is in spring and summer with one to three pale blue green eggs with heavy brown spotting being laid they nest either together in colonies or singly in mixed colonies of other tern and gull species the nest is on the ground among gravel and sand or sometimes on vegetation incubation lasts for 26–28 days the chicks are variable in plumage pattern from pale creamy to darker grey brown this variation assists adults in recognizing their own chicks when returning to the colony from feeding trips fledging occurs after 35–45 days 3 gallery edit two caspian terns in flighta vagrant caspian tern seen in hoskote lake bangalorereferences edit  birdlife international 2015 hydroprogne caspia iucn red list of threatened species iucn 2015 et22694524a84639220 retrieved 25 may 2016  bridge es jones aw baker aj 2005 a phylogenetic framework for the terns sternini inferred from mtdna sequences implications for taxonomy and plumage evolution molecular phylogenetics and evolution 35 459–469 doi101016jympev200412010 pmid 15804415  a b c d e f g del hoyo j elliot a sargatal j eds 1996 handbook of the birds of the world 3 barcelona lynx edicions p 645 isbn 84 87334 20 2  jobling james a 2010 the helm dictionary of scientific bird names london christopher helm pp 93 197 isbn 978 1 4081 2501 4  wild about terns looking after our shorebirds pdf department of the environment and climate change nsw  a b mullarney k svensson l zetterström d grant pj 1999 collins bird guide collins isbn 0 00 219728 6  milman oliver 23 september 2016 terns follow record warm temperatures in shock migration to north of alaska theguardiancom the guardian retrieved 2016 09 27  snow dw perrins cm 1998 the birds of the western palearctic concise ed oxford university press isbn 0 19 854099 x external links edit 
common tern   wikipedia the common tern 2  sterna hirundo is a seabird of the tern family sternidae this bird has a circumpolar distribution its four subspecies breeding in temperate and subarctic regions of europe asia and north america it is strongly migratory wintering in coastal tropical and subtropical regions breeding adults have light grey upperparts white to very light grey underparts a black cap orange red legs and a narrow pointed bill depending on the subspecies the bill may be mostly red with a black tip or all black there are a number of similar species including the partly sympatric arctic tern which can be separated on plumage details leg and bill colour or vocalisationsbreeding in a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives the common tern nests on any flat poorly vegetated surface close to water including beaches and islands and it readily adapts to artificial substrates such as floating rafts the nest may be a bare scrape in sand or gravel but it is often lined or edged with whatever debris is available up to three eggs may be laid their dull colours and blotchy patterns providing camouflage on the open beach incubation is by both sexes and the eggs hatch in around 21–22 days longer if the colony is disturbed by predators the downy chicks fledge in 22–28 days like most terns this species feeds by plunge diving for fish either in the sea or in freshwater but molluscs crustaceans and other invertebrate prey may form a significant part of the diet in some areaseggs and young are vulnerable to predation by mammals such as rats and american mink and large birds including gulls owls and herons common terns may be infected by lice parasitic worms and mites although blood parasites appear to be rare its large population and huge breeding range mean that this species is classed as being of least concern although numbers in north america have declined sharply in recent decades despite international legislation protecting the common tern in some areas populations are threatened by habitat loss pollution or the disturbance of breeding coloniestaxonomy edit the terns family sternidae are small to medium sized seabirds closely related to the gulls skimmers and skuas they are gull like in appearance but typically have a lighter build long pointed wings which give them a fast buoyant flight a deeply forked tail slender legs 3  and webbed feet 4  most species are grey above and white below and have a black cap which is reduced or flecked with white in the non breeding season 3 the common terns closest relatives appear to be the antarctic tern 5  followed by the eurasian arctic and roseate terns genetic evidence suggests that the common tern may have diverged from an ancestral stock earlier than its relatives 6  no fossils are known from north america and those claimed in europe are of uncertain age and species 5 the common tern was first described by linnaeus in his systema naturae in 1758 under its current scientific name sterna hirundo 7  the word stearn was used in old english and a similar word was used by the frisians for tern 8  stearn appears in the poem the seafarer written around 1000 ad 8  linnaeus adopted this word for the genus name sterna the latin for swallow is hirundo and refers here to the terns superficial likeness to that unrelated bird which has a similar light build and long forked tail 9  this resemblance also leads to the informal name sea swallow 10  recorded from at least the seventeenth century 9  the scots names picktarnie 11  tarrock 12  and their many variants are also believed to be onomatopoeic derived from the distinctive call 9  due to the difficulty in distinguishing the two species all the informal common names are shared with the arctic tern 13 four subspecies of the common tern are generally recognized although s h minussensis is sometimes considered to be an intergrade between s h hirundo and s h longipennis 14  15 description edit adult s h hirundo in the harbour of jyväskylä finlandthe nominate subspecies of the common tern is 31–35 cm 12–14 in long including a 6–9 cm 24–35 in fork in the tail with a 77–98 cm 30–39 in wingspan it weighs 110–141 g 39–50 oz 16  breeding adults have pale grey upperparts very pale grey underparts a black cap orange red legs and a narrow pointed bill that can be mostly red with a black tip or all black depending on the subspecies 18  the common terns upperwings are pale grey but as the summer wears on the dark feather shafts of the outer flight feathers become exposed and a grey wedge appears on the wings the rump and tail are white and on a standing bird the long tail extends no further than the folded wingtips unlike the arctic and roseate terns in which the tail protrudes beyond the wings there are no significant differences between the sexes 19  in non breeding adults the forehead and underparts become white the bill is all black or black with a red base and the legs are dark red or black 19  the upperwings have an obvious dark area at the front edge of the wing the carpal bar terns that have not bred successfully may start moulting into non breeding adult plumage from june but late july is more typical with the moult suspended during migration there is also some geographical variation californian birds often being in non breeding plumage during migration 16 juvenile common terns have pale grey upperwings with a dark carpal bar the crown and nape are brown and the forehead is ginger wearing to white by autumn the upperparts are ginger with brown and white scaling and the tail lacks the adults long outer feathers 16  birds in their first post juvenile plumage which normally remain in their wintering areas resemble the non breeding adult but have a duskier crown dark carpal bar and often very worn plumage by their second year most young terns are either indistinguishable from adults or show only minor differences such as a darker bill or white forehead 20 the common tern is an agile flyer capable of rapid turns and swoops hovering and vertical take off when commuting with fish it flies close to the surface in a strong head wind but 10–30 m 33–98 ft above the water in a following wind unless migrating normally it stays below 100 m 330 ft and averages 30 kmh 19 mph in the absence of a tail wind 5  its average flight speed during the nocturnal migration flight is 43–54 kmh 27–34 mph 21  at a height of 1000–3000 m 3300–9800 ft 5 detail of primary featherthe juvenile starts moulting into adult plumage in its first october the head tail and body plumage is replaced first mostly by february then the wing feathers the primaries are replaced in stages the innermost feathers moult first then replacement is suspended during the southern winter birds of this age staying in their wintering areas and recommences in the autumn in may to june of the second year a similar moult sequence starts with a pause during primary moult for birds that return north but not for those that stay in the winter quarters a major moult to adult breeding plumage occurs in the next february to june between 40–90 of feathers being replaced 16  old primary feathers wear away to reveal the blackish barbs beneath the moult pattern means that the oldest feathers are those nearest the middle of the wing so as the northern summer progresses a dark wedge appears on the wing due to this feather ageing process 18 terns are unusual in the frequency in which they moult their primaries which are replaced at least twice occasionally three times in a year the visible difference in feather age is accentuated in the greater ultraviolet reflectance of new primaries and the freshness of the wing feathers is used by females in mate selection 22  experienced females tend to accept mates which best show their fitness through the quality of their wing feathers 23  rarely a very early moult at the nesting colony may be linked to breeding failure both the onset of moult and reproductive behaviour being linked to falling levels of the hormone prolactin 24 similar species edit this arctic tern shows the all red bill greyer underparts translucent flight feathers and narrow black border to the wings which separate it from the common ternthere are several terns of a similar size and general appearance to the common tern a traditionally difficult species to separate is the arctic tern and until the key characteristics were clarified distant or flying birds of the two species were often jointly recorded as commic terns although similar in size the two terns differ in structure and flight the common tern has a larger head thicker neck longer legs and more triangular and stiffer wings than its relative and has a more powerful direct flight 25  the arctic tern has greyer underparts than the common which make its white cheeks more obvious whereas the rump of the common tern can be greyish in non breeding plumage compared to the white of its relative the common tern develops a dark wedge on the wings as the breeding season progresses but the wings of arctic stay white throughout the northern summer all the flight feathers of the arctic tern are translucent against a bright sky only the four innermost wing feathers of the common tern share this property 25  26  the trailing edge of the outer flight feathers is a thin black line in the arctic tern but thicker and less defined in the common 19  the bill of an adult common tern is orange red with a black tip except in black billed s h longipennis and its legs are bright red while both features are a darker red colour in the arctic tern which also lacks the black bill tip 25 in the breeding areas the roseate tern can be distinguished by its pale plumage long mainly black bill and very long tail feathers 26  the non breeding plumage of roseate is pale above and white sometimes pink tinged below it retains the long tail streamers and has a black bill 27  in flight the roseates heavier head and neck long bill and faster stiffer wingbeats are also characteristic 28  it feeds further out to sea than the common tern 27  in north america the forsters tern in breeding plumage is obviously larger than the common with relatively short wings a heavy head and thick bill and long strong legs in all non breeding plumages its white head and dark eye patch make the american species unmistakable 29 in the wintering regions there are also confusion species including the antarctic tern of the southern oceans the south american tern the australasian white fronted tern and the white cheeked tern of the indian ocean identification may be aided by the plumage differences due to opposite breeding seasons the antarctic tern is more sturdy than the common with a heavier bill in breeding condition its dusky underparts and full black cap outline a white cheek stripe in non breeding plumages it lacks or has only an indistinct carpal bar and young birds show dark bars on the tertials obvious on the closed wing and in flight 30  31  the south american tern is larger than the common with a larger more curved red bill and has a smoother more extensive black cap in non breeding plumage 32  like antarctic it lacks a strong carpal bar in non breeding plumages and it also shares the distinctive barring of the tertials in young birds 33  the white fronted tern has a white forehead in breeding plumage a heavier bill and in non breeding plumage is paler below than the common with white underwings 34  the white cheeked tern is smaller has uniform grey upperparts and in breeding pumage is darker above with whiter cheeks 35 juvenile common terns are easily separated from similar aged birds of related species they show extensive ginger colouration to the back and have a pale base to the bill young arctic terns have a grey back and black bill and juvenile roseate terns have a distinctive scalloped saddle 19  hybrids between common and roseate terns have been recorded particularly from the us and the intermediate plumage and calls shown by these birds is a potential identification pitfall such birds may have more extensive black on the bill but confirmation of mixed breeding may depend on the exact details of individual flight feathers 16 the common tern has a wide repertoire of calls which have a lower pitch than the equivalent calls of arctic terns the most distinctive sound is the alarm kee yah stressed on the first syllable in contrast to the second syllable stress of the arctic tern the alarm call doubles up as a warning to intruders although serious threats evoke a kyar given as a tern takes flight and quietens the usually noisy colony while its residents assess the danger 36  a down slurred keeur is given when an adult is approaching the nest while carrying a fish and is possibly used for individual recognition chicks emerge from hiding when they hear their parents giving this call another common call is a kip uttered during social contact other vocalizations include a kakakakaka when attacking intruders and a staccato kek kek kek from fighting males 36 parents and chicks can locate one another by call and siblings also recognise each others vocalisations from about the twelfth day from hatching which helps to keep the brood together 37  38 distribution and habitat edit non breeding adults in brazilmost populations of the common tern are strongly migratory wintering south of their temperate and subarctic northern hemisphere breeding ranges first summer birds usually remain in their wintering quarters although a few return to breeding colonies some time after the arrival of the adults 20  in north america the common tern breeds along the atlantic coast from labrador to north carolina and inland throughout much of canada east of the rocky mountains in the united states some breeding populations can also be found in the states bordering the great lakes and locally on the gulf coast 39  there are small only partially migratory colonies in the caribbean these are in the bahamas and cuba 40  and off venezuela in the los roques and las aves archipelagos 41 new world birds winter along both coasts of central and south america to argentina on the east coast and to northern chile on the west coast 20  39  records from south america and the azores show that some birds may cross the atlantic in both directions on their migration 42  43 the common tern breeds across most of europe with the highest numbers in the north and east of the continent there are small populations on the north african coast and in the azores canary islands and madeira most winter off western or southern africa birds from the south and west of europe tending to stay north of the equator and other european birds moving further south 44  the breeding range continues across the temperate and taiga zones of asia with scattered outposts on the persian gulf and the coast of iran 45  small populations breed on islands off sri lanka 46  47  and in the ladakh region of the tibetan plateau 48  western asian birds winter in the northern indian ocean 20  and s h tibetana appears to be common off east africa during the northern hemisphere winter 49  birds from further north and east in asia such as s h longipennis move through japan thailand and the western pacific as far as southern australia 20  there are small and erratic colonies in west africa in nigeria and guinea bissau unusual in that they are within what is mainly a wintering area 45  only a few common terns have been recorded in new zealand 50  and this species status in polynesia is unclear 51  a bird ringed at the nest in sweden was found dead on stewart island new zealand five months later having flown an estimated 25000 km 15000 mi 52 as long distance migrants common terns sometimes occur well outside their normal range stray birds have been found inland in africa zambia and malawi and on the maldives and comoros islands 53  the nominate subspecies has reached australia 34  the andes and the interior of south america 32  54  asian s h longipennis has recent records from western europe 55 the common tern breeds over a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives nesting from the taiga of asia to tropical shores 56  and at altitudes up to 2000 m 6600 ft in armenia and 4800 m 15700 ft in asia 44  it avoids areas which are frequently exposed to excessive rain or wind and also icy waters so it does not breed as far north as the arctic tern the common tern breeds close to freshwater or the sea on almost any open flat habitat including sand or shingle beaches firm dune areas salt marsh or most commonly islands flat grassland or heath or even large flat rocks may be suitable in an island environment 56  in mixed colonies common terns will tolerate somewhat longer ground vegetation than arctic terns but avoid the even taller growth acceptable to roseate terns the relevant factor here is the different leg lengths of the three species 57  common terns adapt readily to artificial floating rafts and may even nest on flat factory roofs 56  unusual nest sites include hay bales a stump 06 m 20 ft above the water and floating logs or vegetation there is a record of a common tern taking over a spotted sandpiper nest and laying its eggs with those of the wader 58  outside the breeding season all that is needed in terms of habitat is access to fishing areas and somewhere to land in addition to natural beaches and rocks boats buoys and piers are often used both as perches and night time roosts 56 behaviour edit territory edit a chick on an island off the coast of mainethe common tern breeds in colonies which do not normally exceed 2000 pairs 44  but may occasionally number more than 20000 pairs 59  colonies inland tend to be smaller than on the coast common terns often nest alongside other coastal species such as arctic 60  roseate and sandwich terns black headed gulls 61  62  and black skimmers 63  especially in the early part of the breeding season for no known reason most or all of the terns will fly in silence low and fast out to sea this phenomenon is called a dread 44 this autumn juvenile in massachusetts has a white forehead having lost the ginger colouration characteristic of younger birdson their return to the breeding sites the terns may loiter for a few days before settling into a territory 64  and the actual start of nesting may be linked to a high availability of fish 65  terns defend only a small area with distances between nests sometimes being as little as 50 cm 20 in although 150–350 cm 59–138 in is more typical as with many birds the same site is re used year after year with a record of one pair returning for 17 successive breeding seasons around 90 of experienced birds reuse their former territory so young birds must nest on the periphery find a bereaved mate or move to another colony 64  a male selects a nesting territory a few days after his arrival in the spring and is joined by his previous partner unless she is more than five days late in which case the pair may separate 66 the defence of the territory is mainly by the male who repels intruders of either sex he gives an alarm call opens his wings raises his tail and bows his head to show the black cap if the intruder persists the male stops calling and fights by bill grappling until the intruder submits by raising its head to expose the throat aerial trespassers are simply attacked sometimes following a joint upward spiralling flight 64  despite the aggression shown to adults wandering chicks are usually tolerated whereas in a gull colony they would be attacked and killed the nest is defended until the chicks have fledged and all the adults in the colony will collectively repel potential predators 67 breeding edit pairs are established or confirmed through aerial courtship displays in which a male and a female fly in wide circles up to 200 m 660 ft or more calling all the while before the two birds descend together in zigzag glides if the male is carrying a fish he may attract the attention of other males too on the ground the male courts the female by circling her with his tail and neck raised head pointing down and wings partially open if she responds they may both adopt a posture with the head pointed skywards the male may tease a female with the fish not parting with his offering until she has displayed to him sufficiently 68  once courtship is complete the male makes a shallow depression in the sand and the female scratches in the same place several trials may take place until the pair settle on a site for the actual nest 68  the eggs may be laid on bare sand gravel or soil but a lining of debris or vegetation is often added if available 44  or the nest may be rimmed with seaweed stones or shells the saucer shaped scrape is typically 4 cm 16 in deep and 10 cm 39 in across but may extend to as much as 24 cm 94 in wide including the surrounding decorative material 69  breeding success in areas prone to flooding has been enhanced by the provision of artificial mats made from eelgrass which encourage the terns to nest in higher less vulnerable areas since many prefer the mats to bare sand 70  the common tern tends to use more nest material than roseate or arctic terns although roseate often nests in areas with more growing vegetation 71  72 terns are expert at locating their nests in a large colony studies show that terns can find and excavate their eggs when they are buried even if the nest material is removed and the sand smoothed over they will find a nest placed 5 m 16 ft from its original site or even further if it is moved in several stages eggs are accepted if reshaped with plasticine or coloured yellow but not red or blue this ability to locate the eggs is an adaptation to life in an unstable wind blown and tidal environment 57 the peak time for egg production is early may with some birds particularly first time breeders laying later in the month or in june 58  69  the clutch size is normally three eggs larger clutches probably result from two females laying in the same nest egg size averages 41 mm × 31 mm 16 in × 12 in although each successive egg in a clutch is slightly smaller than the first laid 69  the average egg weight is 202 g 071 oz of which 5 is shell 73  the egg weight depends on how well fed the female is as well as on its position in the clutch the eggs are cream buff or pale brown marked with streaks spots or blotches of black brown or grey which help to camouflage them 69  incubation is by both sexes although more often by the female and lasts 21–22 days 73  extending to 25 days if there are frequent disturbances at the colony which cause the adults to leave the eggs unattended 69  nocturnal predation may lead to incubation taking up to 34 days 58  on hot days the incubating parent may fly to water to wet its belly feathers before returning to the eggs thus affording the eggs some cooling 5  except when the colony suffers disaster 90 of the eggs hatch 74  the precocial downy chick is yellowish with black or brown markings 69  and like the eggs is similar to the equivalent stage of the arctic tern 75  the chicks fledge in 22–28 days 73  usually 25–26 44  fledged juveniles are fed at the nest for about five days and then accompany the adults on fishing expeditions the young birds may receive supplementary feeds from the parents until the end of the breeding season and beyond common terns have been recorded feeding their offspring on migration and in the wintering grounds at least until the adults move further south in about december 5  76 like many terns this species is very defensive of its nest and young and will harass humans dogs muskrats and most diurnal birds but unlike the more aggressive arctic tern it rarely hits the intruder usually swerving off at the last moment adults can discriminate between individual humans attacking familiar people more intensely than strangers 77  nocturnal predators do not elicit similar attacks 78  colonies can be wiped out by rats and adults desert the colony for up to eight hours when great horned owls are present 79 common terns usually breed once a year second clutches are possible if the first is lost rarely a second clutch may be laid and incubated while some chicks from the first clutch are still being fed 80  the first breeding attempt is usually at four years of age sometimes at three years the average number of young per pair surviving to fledging can vary from zero in the event of the colony being flooded to over 25 in a good year in north america productivity was between 10 and 20 on islands but less than 10 at coastal and inland sites birds become more successful at raising chicks with age this continues throughout their breeding lives but the biggest increase is in the first five years 5  75  the maximum documented lifespan in the wild is 23 years in north america 81  82  and 33 years in europe 83  84  but 12 years is a more typical lifespan 73 food and feeding edit flying over a pond in england the head and bill point down during a search for fishlike all sterna terns the common tern feeds by plunge diving for fish from a height of 1–6 m 33–197 ft either in the sea or in freshwater lakes and large rivers the bird may submerge for a second or so but to no more than 50 cm 20 in below the surface 85  when seeking fish this tern flies head down and with its bill held vertically 57  it may circle or hover before diving and then plunges directly into the water whereas the arctic tern favours a stepped hover technique 86  and the roseate tern dives at speed from a greater height and submerges for longer 87  the common tern typically forages up to 5–10 km 31–62 mi away from the breeding colony sometimes as far as 15 km 93 mi 88  it will follow schools of fish and its west african migration route is affected by the location of huge shoals of sardines off the coast of ghana 85  it will also track groups of predatory fish or dolphins waiting for their prey to be driven to the seas surface 88  89  terns often feed in flocks especially if food is plentiful and the fishing success rate in a flock is typically about one third higher than for individuals 85 terns have red oil droplets in the cone cells of the retinas of their eyes this improves contrast and sharpens distance vision especially in hazy conditions 90  birds that have to see through an airwater interface such as terns and gulls have more strongly coloured carotenoid pigments in the cone oil drops than other avian species 91  the improved eyesight helps terns to locate shoals of fish although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed or observing other terns diving for food 92  terns eyes are not particularly ultraviolet sensitive an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls 93 the common tern preferentially hunts fish 5–15 cm 20–59 in long 58  85  the species caught depend on what is available but if there is a choice terns feeding several chicks will take larger prey than those with smaller broods 94  the proportion of fish fed to chicks may be as high as 95 in some areas but invertebrate prey may form a significant part of the diet elsewhere this may include worms leeches molluscs such as small squid and crustaceans prawns shrimp and mole crabs in freshwater areas large insects may be caught such as beetles cockchafers and moths adult insects may be caught in the air and larvae picked from the ground or from the water surface prey is caught in the bill and either swallowed head first or carried back to the chicks occasionally two or more small fish may be carried simultaneously 85  when adults take food back to the nest they recognise their young by call rather than visual identification 38 the common tern may attempt to steal fish from arctic terns 95  but might itself be harassed by kleptoparasitic skuas 96  laughing gulls 97  roseate terns 98  or by other common terns while bringing fish back to its nest 95  in one study two males whose mates had died spent much time stealing food from neighbouring broods 99 terns normally drink in flight usually taking seawater in preference to freshwater if both are available 5  chicks do not drink before fledging reabsorbing water and like adults excreting excess salt in a concentrated solution from a specialised nasal gland 100  101  fish bones and the hard exoskeletons of crustaceans or insects are regurgitated as pellets adults fly off the nest to defecate and even small chicks walk a short distance from the scrape to deposit their faeces adults attacking animals or humans will often defecate as they dive often successfully fouling the intruder 5 predators and parasites edit rats will take tern eggs and may even store large numbers in caches 102  and the american mink is an important predator of hatched chicks both in north america and in scotland where it has been introduced 74  the red fox can also be a local problem 103  because common terns nest on islands the most common predators are normally other birds rather than mammals the ruddy turnstone will take eggs from unattended nests 104  105  and gulls may take chicks 106  107  great horned owls and short eared owls will kill both adults and chicks and black crowned night herons will also eat small chicks 5  108  merlins and peregrine falcons may attack flying terns as with other birds it seems likely that one advantage of flocking behaviour is to confuse fast flying predators 67 the common tern hosts feather lice which are quite different from those found in arctic terns despite the close relationship of the two birds 109  it may also be infected by parasitic worms such as the widespread diphyllobothrium species the duck parasite ligula intestinalis and schistocephalus species carried initially by fish tapeworms of the family cyclophyllidea may also infect this species the mite reighardia sternae has been found in common terns from italy north america and china 110  a study of 75 breeding common terns found that none carried blood parasites 111  colonies have been affected by avian cholera and ornithosis 5  and it is possible that the common tern may be threatened in the future by outbreaks of avian influenza to which it is susceptible 88  in 1961 the common tern was the first wild bird species identified as infected with avian influenza the h5n3 variant being found in an outbreak of south african birds 112 dark billed asian subspecies s h longipennis in mooloolaba australiathe common tern is classed as least concern on the iucn red list 1  it has a large population of 1600000–4600000 mature individuals and a huge breeding range estimated at 29200000 km2 11300000 sq mi breeding numbers have been estimated at 250000–500000 pairs the majority breeding in asia up to 140000 pairs breed in europe 113  fewer than 80000 pairs breed in north america with most breeding on the northeast atlantic coast 114  and a declining population of less than 10000 pairs breeding in the great lakes region 115 in the nineteenth century the use of tern feathers and wings in the millinery trade was the main cause of large reductions in common tern populations in both europe and north america especially on the atlantic coasts and inland sometimes entire stuffed birds were used to make hats numbers largely recovered early in the twentieth century mainly due to legislation and the work of conservation organizations 5  103  although some eurasian populations are stable numbers in north america have fallen by more than 70 in the last 40 years and there is an overall negative trend in the global estimates for this species 88 threats come from habitat loss through building pollution or vegetation growth or disturbance of breeding birds by humans vehicles boats or dogs local natural flooding may lead to nest losses and some colonies are vulnerable to predation by rats and large gulls gulls also compete with terns for nest sites some birds are hunted in the caribbean for commercial sale as food 88  breeding success may be enhanced by the use of floating nest rafts man made islands or other artificial nest sites and by preventing human disturbance overgrown vegetation may be burned to clear the ground and gulls can be killed or discouraged by deliberate disturbance 88  contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs resulted in enhanced levels of feminisation in male embryos which seemed to disappear prior to fledging with no effect on colony productivity 116  but dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene dde which results from the breakdown of ddt led to very low levels of successful breeding in some us locations 5 the common tern is one of the species to which the agreement on the conservation of african eurasian migratory waterbirds aewa and the us canada migratory bird treaty act of 1918 apply 117  118  parties to the awea agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan the plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation management of human activities research education and implementation 119  the north american legislation is similar although there is a greater emphasis on protection 120 see also edit references edit  a b birdlife international 2012 sterna hirundo iucn red list of threatened species version 20132 international union for

elegant tern   wikipedia the elegant tern thalasseus elegans syn sterna elegans   see bridge et al 2005 is a seabird of the tern family sternidae it breeds on the pacific coasts of the southern united states and mexico and winters south to peru ecuador and chilethis species breeds in very dense colonies on coasts and islands including montague island mexico 2  and exceptionally inland on suitable large freshwater lakes close to the coast it nests in a ground scrape and lays one to two eggs unlike some of the smaller white terns it is not very aggressive toward potential predators relying on the sheer density of the nests often only 20–30 cm apart and nesting close to other more aggressive species such as heermanns gulls to avoid predationthe elegant tern feeds by plunge diving for fish almost invariably from the sea like most thalasseus terns it usually dives directly and not from the stepped hover favoured by the arctic tern the offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship displaythis pacific species has wandered to western europe as a rare vagrant on a number of occasions and has interbred with the sandwich tern in france there is also one record from cape town south africa in january 2006 the first record for africaetymology edit the current genus name is derived from greek thalassa sea and elegans is latin for elegant fine 3  the genus was created when a 2005b study implied that the systematics of the terns needed review 4 identification edit this is a medium large tern with a long slender orange bill pale grey upperparts and white underparts its legs are black in winter the forehead becomes white juvenile elegant terns have a scalier pale grey back the call is a characteristic loud grating noise like a sandwich ternthis bird could be confused with the royal tern or forsters tern but the royal tern is larger and thicker billed and shows more white on the forehead in winter 5  out of range it can also be easily confused with the lesser crested tern see also orange billed tern and the external link belowthis species is marginally paler above than the lesser crested tern with a white not grey rump with a slightly longer more slender bill with a different curve the black of the crest that comes down from the crown extends through the eye creating a small black smudge in front of the eye on royal tern the black crest stops at the eye and lesser crested tern has a less shaggy crestreferences edit external links edit 
forsters tern   wikipedia the forsters tern sterna forsteri is a member of the tern family sternidae the genus name sterna is derived from old english stearn tern 2  and forsteri commemorates the naturalist johann reinhold forster 3 it breeds inland in north america and winters south to the caribbean and northern central americathis species is rare but annual in western europe and has wintered in ireland and great britain on a number of occasions no european tern winters so far norththis species breeds in colonies in marshes it nests in a ground scrape and lays two or more eggs like all white terns it is fiercely defensive of its nest and youngthe forsters tern feeds by plunge diving for fish but will also hawk for insects in its breeding marshes it usually feeds from saline environments in winter like most sterna terns it usually dives directly and not from the stepped hover favoured by the arctic tern the offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship displaythis is a small tern 33–36 cm 13–14 in long with a 64–70 cm 25–28 in wingspan it is most similar to the common tern it has pale grey upperparts and white underparts its legs are red and its bill is red tipped with black in winter the forehead becomes white and a characteristic black eye mask remains juvenile forsters terns are similar to the winter adult the call is a harsh noise like a black headed gullthis species is unlikely to be confused with the common tern in winter because of the black eye mask but is much more similar in breeding plumage forsters has a grey centre to its white tail and the upperwings are pure white without the darker primary wedge of the common terndescription edit forsters tern is a medium sized tern with a slender body deeply forked long tail and relatively long legs 4  5 in its non breeding plumage the crown is white and a black coma shaped patch covers the eye and the ear covert 4  5  6  the wings are grey with the primaries being dark silver grey while the underside is white 4  5  the bill is black and the legs are a dull brownish red 4 when breeding an intense black cap extending down the neck appears the wings and the back are pale grey while the underside is bright white the bill is orange with a black tip and the legs are bright orange arkive 4  6 the juveniles have coloring similar to a non breeding adult but often have darker primaries 4 taxonomy edit forsters tern is a member of the sternidae they were previously considered as a subfamily of the laridae gull but have been classified as a distinct family since 1838 linneus described the tern using the term rustrum subulatum in reference to their awl shaped bill forsters tern was named in honor of johann reinhold forster a german naturalist 4 habitat and distribution edit forsters tern is a marsh dwelling species it can be found either in freshwater brackish or saltwater it is often found over shallow open water deep in the marsh 6  main habitats are marshes estuaries islands salt marshes and marshy areas surrounding lakes and streams 4 forsters tern is usually restricted to north america 5  it nests in marshes during the summer either on the atlantic or pacific coast but also in the prairies or along the great lakes in canada and the us 4  5  7  due to the instability of its nesting habitat forsters tern exhibits a high annual turnover rate 7 forsters tern also winters in marshes along the southern coast of the us and mexico but can sometimes reach the northern extremity of central america it is also common for the tern to winter in the caribbean 5 it can annually visit western europe and has occasionally wintered in great britain and ireland 4 behavior edit forsters tern is often found in marshes over shallow open water 6  it is a shallow plunge diver that often hovers before attacking when hunting its head is pointed downward whereas when travelling it is pointed forward 4  8 it is a colonial nesting species that builds a shallow nest using marsh vegetation and often competes with gulls for nesting sites 9  10  11  a breeding colony may vary in numbers from a few couples to a thousand individuals 9  in many occasions forsters tern will share nesting sites with the yellow headed blackbird 10 both parents are involved in brood caring and forsters tern does not exhibit sex specific differences in space use 12  males tend to guard the nest more often during the day while the female is more present at night 13  when disturbed newborn chicks tend to crouch and remain silent 14  forsters tern is a single prey loader and provision chicks with prey correlated to their size 15 before breeding males practice courtship feeding 15 vocalization edit the common call of the forsters tern is a descending kerr 4  5  6  the threat call used in defensive attack is a low harsh zaar 4  5  a succession of kerrs is used by the female as a begging call during courtship 4 diet and feeding edit the major constituent of forsters tern diet is fish carp minnow sunfish trout perch trout perch killifish stickleback shiner are common prey in freshwater  15  16  whereas pompano herring menhaden and shiner perch are often consumed in brackish or marine habitats 9  15  on the west coast of the united states and canada forsters tern is also known to prey on pacific lamprey juveniles 17  insects such as dragonflies caddisflies and grasshoppers are often consumed but aquatic insect larvae crustaceans and amphibian can complement the diet 4  9 the forsters tern is a shallow plunge diver having its head pointing downward when hunting 4  8  the attack usually starts in a hovering position before initiating a headfirst dive with wings partially folded backward 8  insects may occasionally be caught by the wing and preys are swallowed in the air 8  15  prey handling behavior may include dropping and re catching fish before swallowing them 8  in some areas forsters tern tends to prefer forage to turbid water this may prevent detection but it may also be a sign of higher prey density and increased presence near the surface preferences for water clarity may depend on prey availability 18 reproduction edit the breeding season for forsters tern can start as early as april on the gulf coast of the united states and extend from may to mid june depending on latitude 4  forsters tern is a colonial nester with colony size ranging from one to a thousand nests 9  adults establish a very small territory around the nest and nests are usually clumped together 4  9  10  males will practice courtship feeding and females will beg for food using a kerr kerr kerr call 4  15 a typical clutch off eggs ranges from 2 to 4 19  the incubation period may last 24 or 25 days after laying 19  20  the young are semi precocial with shell removal being done by the parents 9  the chicks have upper and lower mandible egg teeth which they lose 3 to 5 days after hatching 20  the chicks usually leave the nest with the parents 4 days post hatching and move into areas of denser vegetation 14  19  fledging occurs 28 days after hatching 19  after a few weeks of fledging young terns leave the natal colony but join the group for roosting while migrating towards the wintering ground 4  21 there is a similar involvement from both male and female in incubation and chick rearing males tend to incubate the eggs diurnally and females mostly nocturnally 13  reproductive success varies from year to year and from colony to colony 10 mobbing edit forsters tern exhibits very aggressive behavior when threatened by nest predators if a nest is disturbed the colony mobs the aggressor diving towards it and issuing loud calls 22  aggressiveness increases immediately prior to and during hatching of the chicks ducks and grebes nesting in the same area often benefit from the terns aggressive behavior toward potential predators  9 yellow headed blackbirds sharing nesting sites have been known to actively join tern mobs against predators 10  western grebes recognize the terns alarm call this can be interpreted as information parasitism 23 forsters terns tend to nest in marshy areas either in freshwater or in estuaries the nests are usually located deep within the marsh either on tidal islands or evaporation pond islands but also on manmade dikes 9  11  nests are composed of adjacent marsh vegetation many nests are considered floating and are made of marsh grasses then can be set on top of the vegetation or deposited on floating rafts of vegetation in manitoba there is a strong association between forsters tern nests and muskrat houses they are in fact highly solicited nesting grounds also in manitoba scirpus and often typha are the main plants used for nest building 9  10 in the case of large colonies nesting area availability decreases forsters tern will then nest on sand gravel or mud 9  the nests will consist of a hollow in the substrates either lined with grass or not and driftwood shells dried fish bones and feathers are also often used 19 floating nests are usually tolerant to a slight increase or decrease of water movement but re nesting is common 9  strong wave action wind or flooding usually induced by a storm can often damage the nest and eggs weather is the main explanation for nest failure and egg loss unsheltered nests are more prone to destruction than sheltered one nest made on higher ground are also more shielded from flooding but are more exposed to the wind 9  10 the eggs primary color ranges from a greenish to a brownish hue they are evenly spotted with dark brown almost black or grey spots there are color variations between and within clutches earlier eggs are usually paler greener and larger coloration of the eggs may vary depending on location 9  whitish or cream colored eggs have also been reported 4  9 predator edit raptors such as falcons and hawks as well as owls and corvidae may predate on adults and younglings 9  there have also been anecdotal reports of snapping turtle predating on youngling still in the nest 24  american bittern great blue heron and black crowned heron are also possible predators while gulls and caspian terns notably prey on the eggs of the forsters tern 9 when their ranges overlap marsh rice rats are possibly the most efficient forsters tern egg predator 25  minks are also one of few mammalian predators that can venture in the marsh and prey on eggs and youngling 10 predator success usually remains low during breeding season due to the aggressive mobbing response of adults 9 status and conservation edit according to the iucn the status of the forsters tern is of little concern 1  however degradation of marsh habitat may be threatening boating activity may also affect nest vegetation and increase erosion which may lead to further degradation of tern nesting grounds excessive noise may also have caused nest desertion and chick mortality this species is listed under the migratory birds treaty act in the us it is endangered in illinois and wisconsin while being of special concern in michigan and minnesota preservation of wetlands and introduction of artificial nesting sites may help preserve the species in high risk areas  4 increasing populations of carp in drainage systems causing damages to marsh vegetation may limit habitat availability for forsters tern there have also been anecdotal reports of intense spawning activity of carp damaging terns floating nests 10 as with many species of piscivorous birds forsters tern is susceptible to bioaccumulation of pollutants high mercury concentration may induce biochemical stress reducing the overall health of terns 26  biomethylation of mercury is increased in marshes and salt ponds hence increasing the susceptibility of the forsters tern 27  high levels of selenium may also have deleterious effects on their health 28  organochlorine contaminants such as pcb may also diminish their breeding success 29 gallery edit

least tern   wikipedia the least tern sternula antillarum formerly sterna antillarum is a species of tern that breeds in north america and locally in northern south america it is closely related to and was formerly often considered conspecific with the little tern of the old world other close relatives include the yellow billed tern and peruvian tern both from south americait is a small tern 22–24 cm 87–94 in long with a wingspan of 50 cm 20 in and weighing 39–52 g 14–18 oz the upper parts are a fairly uniform pale gray and the underparts white the head is white with a black cap and line through the eye to the base of the bill and a small white forehead patch above the bill in winter the white forehead is more extensive with a smaller and less sharply defined black cap the bill is yellow with a small black tip in summer all blackish in winter the legs are yellowish the wings are mostly pale gray but with conspicuous black markings on their outermost primaries it flies over water with fast jerky wingbeats and a distinctive hunchback appearance with the bill pointing slightly downwardit is migratory wintering in central america the caribbean and northern south america many spend their whole first year in their wintering area 2  it has occurred as a vagrant to europe with one record in great britainit differs from the little tern mainly in that its rump and tail are gray not white and it has a different more squeaking call from the yellow billed tern in being paler gray above and having a black tip to the bill and from the peruvian tern in being paler gray above and white not pale gray below and having a shorter black tip to the billsubspecies edit the differences among the three subspecies may not be as much as had been thought 3  4 parent feeding a small

considered federally threatened though it is considered threatened in many of the states in which it breeds threats include egg and fledgling predators high tides and recreational use of nesting beachess a athalassos edit the interior subspecies with a current population of about 7000 pairs was listed as an endangered subspecies in 1985 estimated 1000 breeding pairs due to loss of habitat caused by dams reservoirs channelization and other changes to river systemss a browni edit the western population the california least tern was listed as an endangered species in 1972 with a population of about 600 pairs with aggressive management mainly by exclusion of humans via fencing the californian population has rebounded in recent years to about 4500 pairs a marked increase from 582 pairs in 1974 when census work began though it is still listed as an endangered subspecies 3  4  the california subspecies breeds on beaches and bays of the pacific ocean within a very limited range of southern california in san francisco bay and in northwestern mexico while numbers have gradually increased with its protected status it is still vulnerable to predators natural disasters or further disturbance by humans recent threats include the gull billed tern sterna nilotica which can decrease reproductive success in a colony to less than 10 6 nesting and breeding behavior edit the least tern arrives at its breeding grounds in late april the breeding colonies are not dense and may appear along either marine or estuarine shores or on sandbar islands in large rivers in areas free from humans or predators courtship typically takes place removed from the nesting colony site usually on an exposed tidal flat or beach only after courtship has confirmed mate selection does nesting begin by mid may and is usually complete by mid june nests are situated on barren to sparsely vegetated places near water normally on sandy or gravelly substrates in the southeastern united states many breeding sites are on white gravel rooftops 7  in the san francisco bay region breeding typically takes place on abandoned salt flats where the surface is hard this species may use an artificial indentation such as a deep dried footprint to form the nest basinthe nest density may be as low as several per acre but in san diego county densities of 200 nests per acre have been observed most commonly the clutch size is two or three but it is not rare to consist of either one or four eggs both female and male incubate the eggs for a period of about three weeks and both parents tend the semiprecocial young young birds can fly at age four weeks after formation of the new families groupings of birds may appear at lacustrine settings in proximity to the coast late season nesting may be renests or the result of late arrivals in any case the bulk of the population has left the breeding grounds by the end of augustfeeding and roosting characteristics edit the least tern hunts primarily in shallow estuaries and lagoons where smaller fishes are abundant it hovers until spotting prey and then plunges into the water without full submersion to extract meal the most common prey recently for both chicks and adults are silversides smelt atherinops spp and anchovy anchoa spp in southern california 8  as well as shiner perch and small crustaceans elsewhere adults in southern california eat kelpfish most likely giant kelpfish heterostichus rostratus 8  insects are known to be eaten during el niño events 9  10  in southern california least terns feed in bays and lagoons near shore and more than 24 km 15 mi from shore in the open ocean 8  elsewhere they feed in proximity to lagoons or bay mouthsadults do not require cover so that they commonly roost and nest on the open ground after young chicks are three days old they are brooded less frequently by parents and require wind blocks and shade and protection from predators in some colonies in southern california spanish roof tiles are placed in colonies so chicks can hide there notable disruption of colonies can occur from predation by burrowing owls gull billed terns and american kestrels 11  depredation by domestic cats has been observed in at least one colony 12  predation on inland breeding terns by coyotes bobcats feral dogs and cats great blue herons mississippi kites and owls has also been documented 3  4  13

brown thrasher   wikipedia the brown thrasher toxostoma rufum is a bird in the family mimidae which also includes the new world catbirds and mockingbirds the dispersal of the brown thrasher is abundant throughout the eastern and central united states southern and central canada and is the only thrasher to live primarily east of the rockies and central texas it is the state bird of georgiaas a member of the genus toxostoma the bird is a large sized thrasher it has brown upper parts with a white under part with dark streaks because of this it is often confused with the smaller wood thrush hylocichla mustelina among other species the brown thrasher is noted for having over 1000 song types and the largest song repertoire of birds 3  however each note is usually repeated in two or three phrasesthe brown thrasher is an omnivore with its diet ranging from insects to fruits and nuts the usual nesting areas are shrubs small trees or at times on ground level brown thrashers are generally inconspicuous but territorial birds especially when defending their nests and will attack species as large as humans 4 taxonomy and naming edit the brown thrasher was originally described by linnaeus in his 18th century work systema naturae as turdus rufus 5  the genus name toxostoma comes from the ancient greek toxon bow or arch and stoma mouth the specific rufum is latin for red but covers a wider range of hues than the english term 6 although not in the thrush family this bird is sometimes erroneously called the brown thrush 7  the name misconception could be because the word thrasher is believed to derive from the word thrush 8  9  the naturalist mark catesby called it the fox coloured thrush 10 genetic studies have found that the brown thrasher is most closely related to the long billed and cozumel thrashers t longirostre amp guttatum within the genus toxostoma 11  12 description edit the brown thrasher is bright reddish brown above with thin dark streaks on its buffy underparts 13  it has a whitish colored chest with distinguished teardrop shaped markings on its chest its long rufous tail is rounded with paler corners and eyes are a brilliant yellow its bill is brownish long and curves downward both male and females are similar in appearance 14  the juvenile appearance of the brown thrasher from the adult is not remarkably different except for plumage texture indiscreet upper part markings and the irises having an olive color 10 an adult with a juvenile in virginia usathe brown thrasher is a fairly large passerine although it is generally moderate in size for a thrasher being distinctly larger than the sage thrasher oreoscoptes montanus but similar or somewhat smaller in size than the more brownish toxostoma species found further west adults measure around 235 to 305 cm 93 to 120 in long with a wingspan of 29 to 33 cm 11 to 13 in and weigh 61 to 89 g 22 to 31 oz with an average of 68 g 24 oz 15  among standard measurements the wing chord is 95 to 115 cm 37 to 45 in the tail is 109 to 141 cm 43 to 56 in the culmen is 22 to 29 cm 087 to 114 in and the tarsus is 32 to 36 cm 13 to 14 in 10  there are two subspecies 10  the brown thrasher t rufum rufum which lies in the eastern half of canada and the united states 10  and the western brown thrasher t rufum longicauda baird 1858 16  17  which resides in the central united states east of the rocky mountains and southern central canada the western brown thrasher is distinguished by a more cinnamon upper part whiter wing bars and darker breast spots than trufum rufum 10  17 the lifespan of the brown thrasher depends on a year to year basis as the rate of survival the first year is 35 50 in between the second and third year and 75 between the third and fourth year 14  disease and exposure to cold weather are among contributing factors for the limits of the lifespan however the longest lived thrasher in the wild is 12 years and relatively the same for ones in captivity 14 similar species edit the similar looking long billed thrasher has a significantly smaller range 18  it has a gray head and neck and has a longer bill than the brown thrasher 10  the brown thrashers appearance is also strikingly similar to the wood thrush the bird that it is usually mistaken for 10  however the wood thrush has dark spots on its under parts rather than the brown thrashers streaks has dark eyes shorter tail and is a smaller bird 10  19 distribution and habitat edit the brown thrasher resides in various habitats it prefers to live in woodland edges thickets and dense brush 20  often searching for food in dry leaves on the ground 21  it can also inhabit areas that are agricultural and near suburban areas but is less likely to live near housing than other bird species 10  14  the brown thrasher often vies for habitat and potential nesting grounds with other birds which is usually initiated by the males 14 the brown thrasher is a strong but partial migrant as the bird is a year round resident in the southern portion of its range 8  the breeding range includes the united states and canada east of the rocky mountains but has been occasionally spotted west of the rockies 22  23  the increase in trees throughout the great plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated a westward range expansion of the brown thrasher 24  as well as range expansions of many other species of birds 25  26  27  studies indicate that thrashers that reside in the new england region of the united states during the breeding season fly toward the carolinas and georgia birds located in the east of the mississippi winter from arkansas to georgia and birds located in the dakotas and the central canadian provinces head towards eastern texas and louisiana 10  when the species does migrate it is typically for short distances and during the night 14  there are also records of the bird wintering in mexico 28  as well as a british record of a transatlantic vagrant 29 behavior edit the brown thrasher has been observed either solo or in pairs the brown thrasher is usually an elusive bird and maintains its evasiveness with low level flying 30  31  when it feels bothered it usually hides into thickets and gives cackling calls 31  thrashers spend most of their time on ground level or near it when seen it is commonly the males that are singing from unadorned branches 32  the brown thrasher has been noted for having an aggressive behavior 33  and is a staunch defender of its nest 14  however the name does not come from attacking perceived threats but is believed to have come from the thrashing sound the bird makes when digging through ground debris 14  34  it is also thought that the name comes from the thrashing sound that is made while it is smashing large insects to kill and eventually eat 35 feeding edit this bird is omnivorous which has a diet that includes insects berries nuts and seeds as well as earthworms snails and sometimes lizards and frogs 36  across seasons and its breeding range it was found 63 of stomach contents were made of animal matter the remaining 37 being plant material 37  during the breeding season the diet consists primarily of beetles grasshoppers and other arthropods and fruits nuts and seeds more than 80 of the diet of brown thrasher from illinois is made of animal matter about 50 being beetles 38  in iowa about 20 of the summer diet was found to consist of grasshoppers 39  by the late summer it begins to shift towards more of a herbivore diet focusing on fruits nuts seeds and grains 60 of the food in illinois being fruits and seeds 38  40  by winter the customary diet of the brown thrasher is fruit and acorns 41  wintering birds in texas were found to eat 58 plant material mainly sugar berry and poison ivy and 42 animal material in october by march in the dry period when food supply is generally lower 80 of the food became animal and only 20 plants 42  vertebrates are only eaten occasionally and are often comprised by small reptiles and amphibians such as lizards small or young snakes tree frogs and salamanders 37  43 the brown thrasher utilizes its vision while scouring for food it usually forages for food under leaves brushes and soil debris on the ground using its bill 44  it then swipes the floor in side to side motions and investigates the area it recently foraged in 14  the brown thrasher forages in a similar method to the long billed thrasher and bendires thrasher t longirostre amp bendirei picking food off the ground and under leaf litter whereas thrashers with sharply decurved bills are more likely to dig into the ground to obtain food 45  foraging success is 25 greater in dry leaf litter as compared to damp leaf letter 46  the brown thrasher can also hammer nuts such as acorns in order to remove the shell 14  it has also been noted for its flexibility in catching quick insects as the amount of vertebrae in its neck exceeds giraffes and camels 47  in one case a brown thrasher was observed to dig a hole about 15 cm 059 in deep place an acorn in it and hit the acorn until it cracked considered to be a form of tool usage 48  in a laboratory experiment a brown thrasher was found to be able to discern and reject the toxic eastern newt notophthalmus viridescens and a palatable mimic of that species the red salamander pseudotriton ruber but continued to eat palatable dusky salamanders desmognathus spp 49 breeding edit brown thrashers are typically monogamous birds but mate switching does occur at times during the same season 36  50  their breeding season varies by region in the southeastern united states the breeding months begin in february and march while may and june see the commencement of breeding in the northern portion of their breeding range when males enter the breeding grounds their territory can range from 2 to 10 acres 081 to 405 ha 50  51  around this time of the year the males are usually at their most active singing blaringly to attract potential mates and are found on top of perches 36  52  the courting ritual involves the exchanging of probable nesting material males will sing gentler as they sight a female and this enacts the female to grab a twig or leaf and present it to the male with flapping wings and chirping sounds the males might also present a gift in response and approach the female 53  54  both sexes will take part in nest building once mates find each other and will mate after the nest is completed 14 the female lays 3 to 5 eggs that usually appears with a blueish or greenish tint along with reddish brown spots 20  there are rare occurrences of no spots on the eggs 4  the nest is built twiggy lined with grass leaves and other forms of dead vegetation the nests are typically built in a dense shrub or low in a tree usually up to 21 m 69 ft high but have built nests as high as 6 m 20 ft 4  they also on occasion build nests on the ground between eleven days to two weeks the eggs hatch both parents incubate and feed the young with the female doing most of the incubating nine to thirteen days after hatching the nestlings begin to fledge these birds raise two sometimes even three broods in a year 55  the male sings a series of short repeated melodious phrases from an open perch to declare his territory 56  and is also very aggressive in defending the nest known to strike people and animals 57 vocal development edit the male brown thrasher may have the largest song repertoire of any north american bird which has been documented at least over 1100 14  some sources state that each individual has up to 3000 song phrases 58  59  while others stated beyond 3000 60  61  62  the males singing voice usually contains more of a melodic tone than that of the related grey catbird 63  its song are coherent phrases that are iterated no more than three times but has been done for minutes at a time 4  64  by the fall the male sings with smoother sub songs 4  during the winter the males may also sing in short spurts during altercations with neighboring males 41 in the birds youth alarm noises are the sounds made 14  as an adult the brown thrasher has an array of sounds it will make in various situations both male and females make smack and teeooo like alarm calls when provoked and hijjj sounds at dust and dawn 65  others calls may consist of an acute sudden chakk 4  rrrrr a tcheh sound in the beginning that ends with an eeeur kakaka and sounds reminiscent of a stick scraping a concrete sidewalk 66  brown thrashers are noted for their mimicry as a member of the family mimidae but they are not as diverse in this category as their relative the northern mockingbird 4  35  however during the breeding season the mimicking ability of the male is at its best display impersonating sounds from tufted titmice baeolophus bicolor northern cardinals cardinalis cardinalis wood thrushes northern flickers colaptes auratus among other species 50 predation and threats edit although this bird is widespread and still common it has declined in numbers in some areas due to loss of suitable habitat 67  68  69  despite the decrease the rate does not warrant a status towards vulnerable 70  one of the natural nuisances is the parasitic brown headed cowbird molothrus ater but these incidents are rare whenever these situations occur the brown thrashers usually discard of the cowbirds eggs 71  72  occasionally the thrasher has thrown out their own eggs instead of the cowbird eggs due to similar egg size 73  and at least one recorded event raised a fledgling 72  northern cardinals and grey catbirds are also major competitors for thrashers in terms of territorial gain 73  because of the apparent lack of opportunistic behavior around species like these thrashers are prone to be driven out of zones for territory competition 74  brown thrashers have tendencies to double brood or have failures on their first nesting attempts due to predation 74  grey catbirds have been seen invading brown thrashers nests and breaking their eggs 14  other than the catbird snakes birds of prey and cats are among the top predators of the thrasher 71  in kansas at least eight species of snake were identifieid as potentially serious sources of nest failure 75  among the identified avian predators of adults are coopers hawks accipiter cooperii 76  northern goshawk accipiter gentilis 77  broad winged hawks buteo platypterus 78  merlins falco columbarius 79  peregrine falcons falco peregrinus 80  eastern screech owls megascops asio 81  great horned owls bubo virginianus 82  barred owls strix varia 83  and long eared owls asio otus 83 the brown thrasher methods of defending itself include using its bill which can inflict significant damage to species smaller than it along with wing flapping and vocal expressions 71 state bird edit the brown thrasher is the state bird of georgia the brown thrasher also was the inspiration for the name of atlantas

black capped vireo   wikipedia the black capped vireo vireo atricapilla is a small bird native to the united states and mexico it has been listed as an endangered species in the united states since 1987 the iucn lists the species as vulnerabledescription edit the black capped vireo is a songbird about 12 cm 45 inches  in length sexually mature males are olive green above and white below with faint yellow flanks the crown and upper half of the head is black with a partial white eye ring and lores the iris is brownish red and the bill is black females are duller in color than males and have a slate gray crown and underparts washed with greenish yellow first year males often but do not always have more extensive gray in the cap similar to adult femalesnesting edit the male and female in a pair assist in nest construction and incubation typically the female lays three or four eggs the incubation period is 14 to 17 days and the nestling period is 10 to 12 days the female broods over the young while the male supplies most of the food during the nestling phase breeding pairs are capable of producing more than one clutch per breeding season the male cares for some or all of the fledglings while the female re nests sometimes with another male these birds are insectivorous with beetles and caterpillars making up a large part of the dietblack capped vireos nest in shinneries brushy areas with scattered trees shinneries primarily consist of shin oak or sumac appropriate height and density are important factors for this species breeding success foliage that extends to ground level is the most important requirement for nesting most nests are between 15 and 50 inches 35–125 cm above ground level and are screened from view by foliage territories are sometimes located on steep slopes where trees are often clumped and intermediate in height on level terrain preferred black capped vireo habitat is a mixture of shrubs and smaller trees that average from eight to 10 feet high 25 35 m black capped vireos will no longer use sites where many trees are nearing full sizea male sings from a tree in texasdistribution edit the historic breeding distribution of the black capped vireo extended south from south central kansas through central oklahoma and texas to central coahuila mexico at present the range extends from oklahoma south through the edwards plateau and big bend national park texas to at least the sierra madera in central coahuila mexico in oklahoma the black capped vireo is found only in blaine cleveland and comanche counties the winter range of this vireo is not well known it is thought to winter along the west coast of mexico from southern sonora to guerreroconservation edit the black capped vireo is threatened by brown headed cowbird molothrus ater brood parasitism human disturbance and loss of habitat to urbanization fire exclusion grazing and brush controlsee also edit references edit external links edit 
blue headed vireo   wikipedia the blue headed vireo vireo solitarius is a neotropical migrating song bird found in north and central america there are currently two recognized sub species that belong to the blue headed vireo it has a range that extends across canada and the eastern coast of the united states mexico and some of central america it prefers large temperate forests with a mix of evergreen trees and deciduous under growthas the name suggests the blue headed vireo is characterized by its blue grey head and bold yellow wing bars both sexes are very similar in plumage and size juveniles also have a similar plumagepopulations of the blue headed vireo have been steadily increasing since the 1970s and were therefore classified as a least concern species in 2004 2 description edit the blue headed vireo has similar plumage year round and does not drastically change its appearance during the breeding season it can be characterized by its olive green upper body two bold yellow wing bars down the edge of its wing and a deep blue grey crown from which it gets its name the juvenile plumage of immature blue headed vireos is not distinct but very similar to the adult plumage 3  while this bird’s appearance is similar to the closely related cassins vireo vireo cassinii the cassins vireo can be differentiated by its lighter yellow patches a smaller thinner bill and a brownish grey crown 4  there is little to no sexual dimorphism between males and females as both are similar in plumage colouration and size 5 like most vireos the blue headed vireo is a relatively small bird with a length of 126–148 mm 50–58 in the wingspan is usually found to be around 200–240 mm 79–94 in and their weight is typically 13–19 g 046–067 oz there are some subtle differences between the vs solitarius and vs alticola sub species vs alticola the larger of the two sub species has a darker back with a larger wing length of 76–835 mm 299–329 in and a bill length of 11–12 mm 043–047 in conversely vs solitarius is slightly smaller with a wing length of 692–778 mm 272–306 in and a bill length of 89–11 mm 035–043 in 3 the average lifespan of the blue headed vireo in the wild has been measured to be approximately 7 years and 5 months 3 taxonomy edit the blue headed vireo is placed in the genus vireo a group of small migrating passerine birds that are characterized by their usually dull greenish colouring and a simple monotonous song members of this group are usually characterized by the presence or absence of eye rings eye strips and wing bars there is no sexual dimorphism between sexes in this group 5 though it had been previously classified as a separate species the blue headed vireo along with the plumbeous vireo vireo plumbeus and the cassin’s vireo v cassinii were lumped in the 1950s into a single species based on morphological data this group of vireos was collectively known as the solitary vireo vireo solitarius this taxonomy prevailed until 1997 when new molecular data showed that there were in fact three distinct species the taxonomy reverted to that prior to the 1950s and the blue headed vireo was once again its own species 6 there are two recognized subspecies of blue headed vireo 6 vireo solitarius solitarius – wilson a 1810 – is the nominate species it is slightly smaller and breeds across canada to south pennsylvania and new jersey it overwinters in north central and southern mexico 3 vireo solitarius alticola – brewster 1886 – is slightly larger than the nominate species it breeds mainly in the appalachian mountains to northern georgia it overwinters in the gulf states after a short migration 3 habitat and distribution edit native to north america the blue headed vireo enjoys a large breeding range that extends over an immense area of canada and northern united states the breeding range of vs solitarius extends from northeastern british columbia across alberta saskatchewan manitoba ontario and quebec and down to southern pennsylvania and new jersey vs alticola has a distinct breeding range that includes western maryland and south mainly in the appalachian mountains to northern georgia at the end of the breeding season the blue headed vireo migrates south to its overwintering area vs solitarius has the longest migration of the two sub species and inhabits an overwintering area that includes eastern and southern mexico to northern central america vs alticola migrates across a shorter distance to an area that extends from southeastern virginia to texas 3 blue headed vireos prefer to breed in cool temperate forests which in the southern part of its breeding range are found at higher elevations evergreen forests with spruce fir hemlock and pine mixed with deciduous growth such as alder shrubs willow shrubs poplar birch or maple trees are the habitat of choice 7  during the winter blue headed vireos inhabit mixed woods of pines and hardwoods they are also found in coastal and flood plain swamps and low shrubby thickets 3 year round even during the breeding season population density is somewhat low and spread out overwintering population densities are usually found to be lower than in the breeding season 8  the density of the population ultimately depends on the type of forest being inhabited 3 during migration blue headed vireos are often found to flock with groups of different sparrow species but rarely with members of its own species 3 habitat loss edit when blue headed vireos arrive on their breeding grounds typically in mid april many deciduous trees have yet to leaf out leading them to nest in evergreen trees including hemlocks recently however many hemlocks have been killed by an invasive asian insect the hemlock woolly adelgid adelges tsugae leaving the vireos with fewer nesting options until the deciduous trees begin to leaf out 9 behaviour edit vocalizations edit song of a male blue headed vireo in minnesotathe primary song of the blue headed vireo is a simple slow monotonous tune that is often confused with the faster red eyed vireo vireo olivaceus song the primary song is sung only by the males and usually only during the breeding season the males become quite vocal during the breeding season with the song frequency reaching its height prior to mating and then decreasing after copulation both sexes share a series of calls that are used in both defence of nests interspecies competition and communication between breeding pairs while foraging 3 when foraging during the breeding season mated pairs constantly communicate with each other using a series of high pitched chirping calls 3  10 blue headed vireos are mainly insectivorous birds but are also known to eat fleshy berries and fruit they are equipped with short strong bills used for processing insect prey with a tough carapace such as beetles foraging usually occurs in the mid level of trees a foraging blue headed vireo will hop from branch to branch on the same or to an adjacent tree and will then fly towards its prey to capture it 3  typical prey consist mostly of caterpillars butterflies and moths but may also include tree bugs stink bugs beetles bees ants flies dragonflies grasshoppers crickets spiders and on some occasions snails 3  fruit feeding occurs primarily during migration and overwintering especially when overwintering in more tropical regions where fruit is more abundant or if the insect populations are low this large and varied diet is an example of an opportunistic feeding strategy allowing the blue headed vireo to be plastic in its ability to adapt to resource availability 11 reproduction edit when arriving to the breeding ground in mid april male vireos will hold large individual territories that can range from 15–66 hectares 37–163 acres females will choose a male to mate with depending on the male’s ability to defend and control a large territory while defending their territory from other males the male vireos will sing a primary song to attract females 12  undecided females can usually be seen flying along the edges of competing male territories usually this will force the two males into direct conflict for the right to copulate with the female 10  12 once a female has approached a suitable mate the male will perform a series of mating rituals typically these rituals involve the male building a courtship nest for the female the courtship nest is not a full nest but is most likely an attempt by the male to display his ability to gather resources 10  12  once the pair is established the courtship nest is abandoned mating does not occur for approximately 2 weeks after pair has been established during this time the male and the female will cooperatively build a breeding nest which is typically formed between forking mid level branches of evergreen and deciduous trees and are composed of twigs and foliage breeding nests are not reused in following breeding seasons 3 in one breeding season a female will lay 3–5 eggs at a rate of 1 egg per day eggs are creamy white with brown or black spots and are 17–231 x 133–158 mm 0055–0075 in x 004–005 in eggs are incubated for approximately 14 days after being laid once hatched infants are highly altricial often having little to no downy feathers infants open their eyes during day 5 or 6 and will begin to fledge after 14 days for a total chick rearing period of 28 days once the young are able to leave the nest the parents will split the juveniles and separate juveniles are usually dependent on the parent to provide food for approximately 1 month after leaving the nest if the nest is destroyed or a mating pair produces a failed brood an attempt to re nest may occur but this ultimately depends on when the brood fails if the brood fails early on in the season there is a higher chance that the pair will re nest if later the pair will often separate and not attempt a second brood 3 blue headed vireo’s have an atypical breeding strategy when compared to other closely related species blue headed vireo males will assist their mates with daytime incubation of eggs nest construction and feeding of the chicks 10  also unlike most bird species female blue headed vireos do not attempt any extra pair copulations with other males likewise males make no attempt to guard females from other males making blue headed vireos both socially and genetically monogamous birds 10 hormonal effects on parental care edit the increase in male blue headed vireo parental care is thought to be attributed to the levels of testosterone and prolactin found in the plasma of these birds during the mating season testosterone a steroid hormone that is secreted by the testes has been found to increase aggressive behaviour in male birds during the breeding season 13  and that these males display less parental care if their testosterone levels are maintained 14  conversely prolactin is a peptide hormone that is regulated by the hypothalamus that has been found at higher levels in birds that do the majority of incubation 15  it was found that in the early breeding season male blue headed vireos have a low testosterone level and will maintain this low level at all stages of the season 16  this low level does not affect the vireo’s ability to compete with other males for territory however as a high testosterone level has been found to not be necessary for territory establishment 17  prolactin levels of the males were found to be high very early on in the breeding season and are maintained for the duration of the season this high level of prolactin along with a low testosterone level explains why male blue headed vireos are so involved in the construction of the nest daytime incubation and feeding of the nestlings 10  16 predation edit blue headed vireos have a low nesting success rate with about 10–30 of hatchlings surviving 3  common predators of the blue headed vireo eggs and chicks include blue jays crows and squirrelsoften when a nest is attacked by a blue jay the male and female will execute coordinated attacks on the approaching predator this usually involves one partner swooping towards the blue jay while calling the mate who will then execute a second attack 10  blue headed vireos have also been known to nest close to nesting raptorial birds that do not prey on them it is thought that they use the raptors as protection from squirrels that are in turn hunted by these bird of prey 3 the largest contributor to the low nesting success rate of the blue headed vireo is most likely the parasitic brown headed cowbird molothrus ater these birds will often lay their large eggs overtop the existing brood causing the parents to feed the cowbird which will ultimately starve the infant vireos 3 references edit  birdlife international 2012 vireo

red eyed vireo   wikipedia the red eyed vireo vireo olivaceus is a small american songbird 13–14 cm 51–55 in in length it is somewhat warbler like but not closely related to the new world warblers parulidae common across its vast range this species is not considered threatened by the iucnvireo is a latin word referring to a green migratory bird perhaps the female golden oriole possibly the european greenfinch the specific olivaceus is new latin for olive green from latin oliva olive 2  3 description and systematics edit chivi vireo at registro são paulo braziladults are mainly olive green on the upperparts with white underparts they have a red iris and a grey crown edged with black there is a dark blackish line through the eyes and a wide white stripe just above that line they have thick blue grey legs and a stout bill they are yellowish on the flanks and undertail coverts though this is faint in some populationsthis bird not always seen may sing for long periods of time it appears to be endlessly repeating the same question and answer it holds the record for most songs given in a single day among bird species more than 20000 songs in one daythe subspecies breeding in south america have a simpler song a chestnut iris and different remiges proportions they are sometimes split as the chivi vireo v chivi some of the races concerned are v o chivi v o vividior and v o tobagoensis the last being a relatively large subspecies endemic to tobago even within the chivi vireo there are distinct variations in measurements song and ecology but the possible taxonomic significance of this remains unclearin the past the yellow green vireo v flavoviridis and the noronha vireo v gracilirostris have been considered as subspecies of the red eyed vireoecology edit the breeding habitat is open wooded areas across canada and the eastern and northwestern united states these birds migrate to south america where they spend the winter the latin american population occur in virtually any wooded habitat in their range most of these are residents but the populations breeding in the far southern part of this species range eg most of its range in argentina uruguay paraguay and bolivia migrate north as far as central americathis vireo is one of the more frequent american passerine vagrants to western europe with more than one hundred records mainly in ireland and great britain in northern ohio it seems to return to breed at about the same time as one century ago but it may leave for winter quarters one or two weeks earlier at present than it did in the past 4 red eyed vireos glean insects from tree foliage favouring caterpillars and aphids and sometimes hovering while foraging in some tropical regions they are commonly seen to attend mixed species feeding flocks moving through the forest higher up in the trees than the bulk of such flocks 5 they also eat berries especially before migration and in the winter quarters where trees bearing popular fruit like tamanqueiro alchornea glandulosa or gumbo limbo bursera simaruba will even attract them to parks and gardens 6  fruit are typically not picked up from a hover but the birds often quite acrobatically reach for them even hanging upside down 7 the nest is a cup in a fork of a tree branch the red eyed vireo suffers from nest parasitism by the brown headed cowbird molothrus ater in the north of its range and by the shiny cowbird m bonariensis further south parasitism by haemoproteus 8  and trypanosomans might affect these birds not infrequently as was noted in studies of birds

black throated blue warbler   wikipedia the black throated blue warbler setophaga caerulescens is a small passerine bird of the new world warbler family its breeding ranges are located in the interior of deciduous and mixed coniferous forests in eastern north america over the cooler months it migrates to islands in the caribbean and central america it is a very rarely found in western europe where it is considered to be a non indigenous species the black throated blue warbler is sexually dimorphic the adult male has a black face and cheeks deep blue upperparts and white underparts while the adult female is olive brown above and light yellow belowpredominantly insectivorous the black throated blue warbler supplements its diet with berries and seeds in winter it builds its nests in thick shrubs and the closeness of its nesting sites to the ground make it a favored species for the study of warbler behavior in the wild the black throated blue warbler defends its territory against other birds of the same species for both nesting and winter habitats as the black throated blue warbler requires large unbroken forest areas for nesting its numbers are decliningtaxonomy and phylogeny edit the german naturalist johann friedrich gmelin described the black throated blue warbler in 1789 its species name is the latin adjective caerulescens meaning turning bluethe black throated blue warbler is one of the new world warblers or wood warblers in the family parulidae this species was originally placed under the genus dendroica it was recently adjusted to be a member of genus setophaga along with all other members of the genus dendroica based on the findings from a recent phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial dna and nuclear dna in 2010 2  the old genus dendroica was then deleted 3  within the genus it appears to have no particularly close relatives 2 the species breeds in north america and winters in the caribbean some studies have observed significant differences in terms of migratory behavior and plumage color between northern and southern populations within the breeding range 4  the northern population mainly winters in the western caribbean cuba and jamaica while the southern population usually spends the winter on eastern islands hispaniola and puerto rico moreover males in the southern population have darker plumage than those in the northern population these differences have led biologists to consider them as separate subspecies however a recent study in the united states reveals no significant genetic differentiation between northern samples from michigan new hampshire and new york states and southern populations sample from north carolina 5  the study results actually show a recent population expansion from a single glacial refugium therefore the current populations are homogeneous in terms of genetics the differentiation that is observed between the northern and southern populations should have occurred quite recently 5 description edit female black throated blue warbler foraging for termites at the john heinz national wildlife refugethe black throated blue warbler measures 13 cm 51 in in length and weighs 84–124 g 030–044 oz 6  the adult male has white underparts with a black throat face and flanks the upperparts are deep blue the immature male is similar but with greener upperparts the female has olive brown upperparts and light yellow underparts with darker wings and tail gray crown and brown patches on the cheek both sexes have a thin pointed bill and small white wing patches which are not always visible like many other warbler species it has colorful plumage during the spring and summer however outside the breeding season its plumage is drab and less distinctive in the fall the black throated blue warbler can be distinguished by its small white wing patches juveniles have brown upperparts with a creamy supercilium and brownish spots on the throat the breast and the belly 6 the birds song can be described as a buzzed zee zee zeeee with an upward inflection its call is a flat ctuk 7  8 distribution and habitat edit the black throated blue warbler is a migratory species it breeds in temperate mature deciduous forests or mixed coniferous deciduous forest with a thick understory the species is often found in hilly and mountainous regions in the northeastern united states and southeastern canada 9  in late summer it migrates to the tropical wooded and scrub habitats in the greater antilles for wintering along the migration route the black throated blue warbler can be observed in habitats such as parks and gardens 6  9  its nesting site is more important than its foraging site in playing a role in determining the habitat of the black throated blue warbler 10  the black throated blue warbler is an open nesting species that nests very close to the ground so it has to choose a protected nesting site where the risk of predation is relatively low 11 behavior edit feeding and foraging edit the black throated blue warbler forages actively in low vegetation sometimes hovering or catching insects in flight it often forages in one area for a while before moving on to the next it mainly eats invertebrates such as caterpillars crane flies and spiders it may supplement its diet with seeds berries and fruit in the winter 7 males and females prefer different foraging sites while males usually hover among the higher shrub foliage between 3 and 9 m 98 and 295 ft females tend to forage at lower strata 10  the time within a breeding season influences where the males forage when it is time to feed the fledglings males come down to the same foraging strata as females the black throated blue warbler mostly forages in the understory instead of the canopy 12  the large leaves and long branches in the understory affect its foraging behaviors the black throated blue warbler more often hovers rather than gleans its prey because it is more difficult to glean among thick understory foliage 12 breeding edit the black throated blue warbler is a monogamous species 13  its breeding season usually begins in may and ends in july 14  as a songbird the male black throated blue warbler attracts a female’s attention by singing a soft melody he then follows the female while she is foraging or searching for nesting sites as soon as the female stops to rest the male droops his wings slightly stretches his head forward and up opens his bill and faces the female the female also makes displays to the male by vibrating her wings in response the male mounts the female for 2–3 seconds and then flies off 9 a 1996 researchers showed that the black throated blue warbler prefers to reside in hardwood forests with higher shrub densities where food is more abundant compared to lower shrub density plots within these high shrub density habitats not only is there a higher density of warblers but the population age average is also older being composed of males and females who are at least two years of age 15 the black throated blue warbler uses social cues in its evaluation and choice of nesting sites 14  in particular it listens to the post breeding songs given out by other males these songs have strong temporal dependencies males sing at the beginning and the peak of breeding season but songs are not indicative of reproductive success near the end of a breeding season a male that has successfully mated continues to sing while a male that has failed to reproduce abandons the habitat therefore post breeding songs are reliable indicators of reproductive success within the particular habitat and convey essential information to the natal and breeding dispersers in comparison to the traditional idea of direct assessment of the vegetation structure the vocal cue is much more efficient and easier to obtain hence revealing the advantage of social communication in survival and reproduction a female however does not respond to post breeding songs directly instead she is likely to rely on the presence of males in deciding nesting sites 14 although the black throated blue warbler is a socially monogamous species males are frequently observed in territories of other males suggesting the occurrence of extra pair matings 13  16  nestling parentage is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the hubbard brook experimental forest in new hampshire 17  the results show that extra pair fertilization occurs and that the majority of the extra pair sires come from males in neighboring territories only very few extra pair sires are from distant territories this local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony but there is no significant association with population level synchrony 13 males engage in mate guarding during the period females are most vulnerable to successful extra pair copulations they usually stay close to their social mate singing slowly on the side and following the mate while she is foraging or searching for a nesting site 9  the guarding behavior though may conflict with males’ pursuit of extra pair fertilizations it is not yet clear to what extent a male will prefer mate guarding over extra pair fertilizations 13  male retention studies have shown that removal of a male increases the chance of extra pair offspring in the brood suggesting that mate guarding reduces extra pair fertilization attempts 16  the extra pair fertilization rate nonetheless cannot be eliminated even if males are allowed to stay near their social mates during fertility risk period several hypotheses try to explain this phenomenon females may be able to manage extra pair mating even while its social mate is guarding it or females may reject extra pair copulation attempts by other males in the absence of male guarding 16 females who participate in extra pair fertilizations may incorporate better genes in their offspring than they could get with their social mate but they are likely to receive less help with parental care from their social mates because of cheating extra pair fertilization therefore can be costly to females as well 18  a possible theory why extra pair fertilization occurs is that female organisms select males with overall high heterozygosity or dissimilar genetics from themselves 19  20  a microsatellite study suggests an alternative to heterozygosity selection because no correlation is found between female extra pair fertilization frequencies and the overall heterozygosity of their social mates it is suggested that females may choose only a selective set of heterozygous genes particularly the mhc locus which can affect the immunocompetence of offspring 21 sexual selection edit black throated blue warblers singing in smoky mountain north carolinaproblems playing this file see media helpmales’ differential recognition of local and nonlocal songs has been studied in two populations one in the northern united states new hampshire and the other in the southern united states north carolina 22  an asymmetry of response has been found between the two populations the northern black throated blue warbler responds strongly to local songs but relatively weakly to the song of southern warblers in contrast a warbler from the south responds equally to songs from both the north and the south a potential explanation of this asymmetry is the difference in female preference between the northern and southern black throated blue warblers females from the north are less likely to mate with a “heterospecific” male from the south therefore it is not necessary for a northern male to respond strongly to the song of a southern challenger it is possible that a barrier to gene flow from south to north exists while a barrier to the reverse does not therefore female choice of male songs is likely to play a role in gene flow and reproductive isolation which may eventually lead to diversification 22 it has long been believed that a male black throated blue warbler achieves reproductive maturation well into its first breeding season 23  24  25  a yearling participates in extra pair mating and cuckoldry as much as or even more than older males however research by graves has found opposing evidence in terms of testicular size and sperm production 26  directional asymmetry is present in many passerine birds the left testicle is often larger in size than the right one and this holds true for both yearling and older male warblers however the testicle to body mass ratio nonetheless is much lower in yearlings than in older males moreover older males have a greater degree of directional asymmetry than do yearlings because the size of testes in birds is correlated to the ejaculate quality it is likely that females employ age dependent choice in favor of older males who can be distinguished by their definitive age specific plumage 26 status and threats edit the black throated blue warbler enjoys a large range and a big population its population trend is currently increasing this species was ranked as least concern by the iucn in 2012 1  deforestation and habitat fragmentation are threatening the black throated blue warbler in its tropical wintering areas 7  a report in 2000 discussed the impact of global climate change on the population dynamics of the black throated blue warbler by an observation from 1986 to 1998 in particular the effect of el niño southern oscillation enso was studied in relation to the survival fecundity and recruitment of this migratory bird 27  it was found that el niño years the warm south pacific oceanic phase were associated with lower adult survival rate in their wintering ground jamaica lower fecundity in the breeding habitats in new hampshire of the united states and lower annual recruitment of yearlings and juveniles to both breeding and wintering grounds all the three factors were relatively higher during la niña years cold south pacific ocean when the weather was wetter and the food availability was much more abundant long term global warming can aggravate the enso effect adding to the fluctuation of the black throated blue warbler population 28 references edit  a b c birdlife international 2012 dendroica caerulescens iucn red list of threatened species

pennsylvanicus means  pennsylvania  2 migration range edit these birds are migratory wintering in central america south to northern colombia 3  with an unconfirmed sighting from as far south as ecuador they are also very rare vagrants to western europe they arrive in their breeding range in may and depart by mid september 4 description edit adult male summer topyoung male centeradult winter belowthis species is a moderately sized new world warbler despite having very different plumage it is thought to be closely related to the widespread yellow warbler in total this species measures from 10 to 14 cm 39 to 55 in in length and spans 16 to 21 cm 63 to 83 in across the wings body weight ranges from 8 to 131 g 028 to 046 oz among standard measurements the wing chord is 57 to 68 cm 22 to

they display dark streaked gray backs white faces black eyestripes and greenish crowns their underparts are white with chestnut flanks and they also have two white wing bars the adult females resemble washed out versions of the summer male and in particular the females lack the strong head pattern and also have little to no chestnut coloring on their flanksnon breeding birds of both sexes have greenish heads and greenish upperparts which are usually unstreaked they also have unstreaked pale grey breasts their wing bars are always present in their plumages their lack of streaking and greenish backs helps to distinguish this species from the larger blackpoll warbler in the fallthe songs are high whistled lines often described as pleased pleased pleased to meecha this accented song is used primarily to attract a female and decrease in frequency once nesting is well under way males also sing unaccented songs without the meecha at the end and these are used mostly in territory defense and aggressive encounters with other males some males sing only unaccented songs and they are less successful at securing mates than males that sing both songs their calls are harsh chipsbreeding and habitat edit the chestnut sided warbler has benefited from the clearing of mature forests they make use of the abundant second growth habitats 6  in the tropics where they winter however the species occurs mostly in mature tropical rainforests their cup shaped nests are placed in a low bush which is usually located in young deciduous woodland or scrub these birds lay 3–5 eggs that are creamy white or greenish with brown speckles in color the nest is a small cup woven of bark strips weed stems grasses and plant down the nest is usually placed in a small crotch of a shrub or vertical tangle of vines no more than 2 m 66 ft above the ground 7  this species is frequently parasitized by brown headed cowbirdspopulation edit this birds numbers have increased as second growth forest became more common in the east in the late 19th century their numbers have declined slightly since thenchestnut sided warblers are primarily insectivorous they forage actively in shrubs and small trees and sometimes will attempt to catch insects in mid air most foraging consists of gleaning insects from foliage they will include berries in their winter diets such as those of cymbopetalum mayanum such trees can be used to attract wintering birds into gardens and parks 8 references edit  birdlife international 2012 dendroica pensylvanica iucn red list of threatened species version 20132

magnolia warbler   wikipedia the magnolia warbler setophaga magnolia is a member of the wood warbler family parulidaeetymology edit the genus name setophaga is from ancient greek ses moth and phagos eating and the specific magnolia refers to the type locality american ornithologist alexander wilson found this species in magnolias near fort adams mississippi 2 description edit first year male magnolia warblerthis species is a moderately small new world warbler it measures 11 to 13 cm 43 to 51 in in length and spans 16 to 20 cm 63 to 79 in across the wings body mass in adult birds can range from 66 to 126 g 023 to 044 oz though weights have reportedly ranged up to 15 g 053 oz prior to migration among standard measurements the wing chord is 54 to 64 cm 21 to 25 in the tail is 46 to 52 cm 18 to 20 in the bill is 08 to 1 cm 031 to 039 in and the tarsus is 17 to 185 cm 067 to 073 in 3  4  the magnolia warbler can be distinguished by its coloration the breeding males often have white gray and black backs with yellow on the sides yellow and black striped stomachs white gray and black foreheads and beaks distinct black tails with white stripes on the underside and defined white patches on their wings called wing bars 5  breeding females usually have the same type of coloration as the males except that their colors are much duller immature warblers also resemble the same dull coloration of the females 6  the yellow and black striped stomachs help one to distinguish the males from other similar birds like the prairie warbler and kirtlands warbler which however have a breeding range to the south and east of the magnolia warblers 5 distribution edit the magnolia warbler is found in the northern parts of some midwestern states and the very northeastern parts of the us with states such as minnesota and wisconsin comprising its southernmost boundaries however it is mostly found across the northern parts of canada such as in saskatchewan manitoba ontario and quebec during the winter the warbler migrates through the eastern half of the united states to southern mexico and central america 7  the warbler breeds in dense forests 6  where it will most likely be found among the branches of young densely packed coniferous trees 5  the magnolia warbler migrates to the warmer south in the winter wintering in southeastern mexico panama and parts of the caribbean in migration it passes through the eastern part of the united states as far west as oklahoma and kansas 8  during migration season the magnolia warbler can be found in various types of woodlandslife cycle edit the magnolia warbler undergoes multiple molts during its lifetime the first molts begin while the young offspring are still living in the nest while the rest take place on or near their breeding grounds 5  the warblers molt breed care for their offspring and then migrate chicks hatch after a two week incubation period and can fledge from the nest after close to another two weeks when their feathers are more developed after about a month the chicks can leave the nest to begin living and later breeding on their own since they are solitary birds magnolia warblers typically live up to seven years 9 behavior edit diet and feeding edit this warbler usually eats any type of arthropod but their main delicacies are caterpillars 10  the warbler also feeds on different types of beetles butterflies spiders and fruit during their breeding season while they increase their intake of both fruit and nectar during the winter 5  these birds also tend to eat parts of the branches of mid height coniferous trees such as spruce firs 10  in their usual breeding habitatmagnolia warbler song recorded in minnesota in late mayresearchers have observed two different types of songs in male magnolia warblers their songs have been referred to as the first category song and the second category song 11  females have not been observed to have a distinct song yet as the males have while they do sing they don’t have separate songs for different situations in general the male warblers use their songs during the spring migration season and during the breeding season one is used for courtship and the other is used to mark their territory each day 11  both males and females have call notes that they use for various alerts the females have short call notes to signal when a human observer is watching them and the males have short call notes to signal when any sort of threatening predators are close to their offspringreproduction edit male magnolia warblers go to their breeding grounds about two weeks before the females arrive after the females come to the breeding grounds both the males and females cooperate to build the nest for a week because of the difficulty of locating their nests among the forest’s dense undergrowth it is hard to know whether the warblers re use their original nests each breeding season or whether they abandon them for new ones the nests are built in their tree of choice – different types of fir trees such as abies balsamea balsam fir and picea glauca spruce fir 6  the nest is made up of grass twigs and horsehair fungus and they are relatively small shallow circular shaped nests barely exceeding 10 cm on all sides 5  the nests are usually found close to the ground commonly in the lowest three meters of the firsfemale magnolia warblers usually lay three to five eggs during each breeding season the female will not incubate her eggs until all of them are laid the female sits on the eggs for about two weeks before the eggs hatch the female is also the one that warms the newborn chicks by brooding or sitting on the nest she is also the one who feeds the newborn chicks most frequently though the males also engage in feeding the offspring at times 12  because the males are technically as equally responsible for feeding the newborns as the females are this means that the males are monogamous because they expend a large amount of energy looking for food for their young in order to keep the nest clean females eat the fecal sacs of their newborns as the chicks grow older both parents simply remove the sacs from the nest the baby warblers are ready to fly out of the nest by the time they are ten days oldconservation edit the magnolia warbler is assessed on the iucn red list as least concern for conservation because it is fairly widespread and common within its habitat and not at risk of extinction research has shown that a good percentage of warblers die from flying into television towers in their migratory path also parts of their habitat have been degraded as coniferous forests are cleared which causes the number of warblers living in a habitat to decrease but they certainly are not greatly affected by the deforestation while the deforestation does decrease the warbler population in the specific area that it occurs in the species is not significantly impacted overall due to the general abundance of the species throughout the region 1  13 john james audubon illustrated the magnolia warbler in the birds of america second edition published london 1827–38 as plate 123 under the title black amp yellow

ti males sing from open perches on the nesting territory the call sounds like a high seet western birds of the race ridgwayi have a slightly lower pitched richer song and a sharper call note 3 taxonomy edit a young female in madison wisconsinthe nashville warbler was originally described as sylvia ruficapilla by alexander wilson in 1811 using a name which had already been used by john latham but not in a valid description according to the international code of zoological nomenclature possibly unintentionally wilson spelled its name as sylvia rubricapilla in a later volume in 1812 and this spelling was once commonly used 4  the genus sylvia is now restricted to old world species of the family sylviidae unrelated to species such as the nashville warbler that are classified in the new world warbler family parulidae until recently most taxonomies have put this species in the genus vermivora however this species forms a clade with several related species classed in vermivora such as the tennessee warbler and lucys warbler which are more closely related to the flame throated warbler and crescent chested warbler than to other species of vermivora 5  they therefore are now classified in the genus oreothlypis along with the flame throated and crescent chested warblers 6  although the new genus leothlypis was initially proposed for the nashville warbler and allies excluding the latter two species 7 two subspecies exist with discrete breeding ranges the nominate subspecies o r ruficapilla breeds in northeastern north america the other subspecies o r ridgwayi known as the calaveras warbler nests in western north america the latter differs from the former in its relatively duller plumage and more persistent tail movements 5 distribution and habitat edit nashville warblers breed in two distinct areas one in canada and the northeastern united states and another in the western united states the northeastern part of its range extends from côte nord and cape breton island in eastern canada to central alberta for the most part it only breeds between about 52 and 455 degrees north but it is also found less commonly in the appalachians of pennsylvania and west virginia although named after nashville tennessee the nashville warbler only visits that area during migration they migrate to southernmost texas and california mid mexico and the northernmost parts of central america guatemala and el salvador in winter in their breeding range they prefer open mixed woods and bog habitats 8 behavior edit a nest with an egg and newly hatched nestlings in bellefeuille quebecnashville warblers forage by gleaning in the lower parts of trees and shrubs frequently flicking their tails in winter they join together into loose flocks and sometimes join mixed species feeding flocks these birds mainly eat insects but will supplement this diet with berries and nectar in the winter 2 nashville warblers conceal their nests on the ground under shrubs nests are open cups built out of bark strips leaves and moss and are lined with fine materials such as feathers or hairs typically four or five eggs are laid in a clutch and incubated for 11–12 days only the female incubates the eggs though the male brings her food on hatching the young have no feathers apart from some brown down and their eyes are closed 8  juveniles fledge and leave the nest 11 days after hatching 2 there is a single record of hybridization with the tennessee warbler 2 references edit  birdlife international 2012 vermivora ruficapilla iucn red list of threatened

patch depending on the subspecies that mark is reduced or absent in the female it breeds across canada and south through the western united states and winters from mexico south through much of central america it is a very rare vagrant to western europedescription edit the wilsons warbler is a small passerine ranging from 10 to 12 cm 39 to 47 in in length with a wingspan of 14–17 cm 55–67 in and a mass of 5–10 g 018–035 oz 2  it has a plain green brown back and yellow underparts the male has a small black cap males of the western race w p chryseola are greener above and brighter than males of the eastern nominate race individuals from alaska and the west central portion of the species range average slightly larger than those found in eastern and pacific coastal populations 2 wilsons warbler song recorded in minnesota in mid mayits song is a chattering series of loud descending notes the call is a flat chuff 3 taxonomy and etymology edit the wilsons warbler was first described in 1811 by the ornithologist alexander wilson who placed it in the genus muscicapa the species was moved to wilsonia by the naturalist and ornithologist charles lucien bonaparte in 1838 zoologist thomas nuttall moved it to sylvania in 1840 and by 1845 many authors included it in myiodioctes in 1899 the american ornithological union returned the species to wilsonia 4  the species is currently assigned to the genus cardellina 5  the genus name cardellina is a diminutive of the italian dialect cardella a name for the european goldfinch and the specific epithet pusilla means very small 6 there are three recognized subspeciesthe chryseola subspecies which nests in northern coastal california to southwestern coastal canada has a distinctive orange tinged yellow forehead the population of the subspecies has declined sharply in the 21st century because it migrates preferentially to the southern end of the baja peninsula in mexico 8  where luxury resort and residential developments have replaced the birds habitat 9 the wilsons warbler resembles the yellow warbler the latter is readily distinguished by its different shape yellow wing markings and yellow tail spots 10 range and habitat edit the breeding habitat is fairly open woodland with undergrowth or shrubs and thickets in moist areas with streams ponds bogs and wet clearings 3  wilsons warbler breeds in northern canada and the western us it winters in overgrown clearings and coffee plantations 3  forest edges deciduous forests tropical evergreens pine oak forests mangroves thorn scrub riparian gallery forests brushy fields and mixed forests  at all seasons it prefers secondary growth riparian habitats lakes montane and boreal forests with overgrown clearcuts it is a very rare vagrant to western europe 2 behavior edit feeding edit wilsons warbler is an insectivore feeding primarily on insects gleaned from leaves and twigs or caught by flycatching 11  some of these insects include beetles bees or caterpillars the wilsons warbler is an active forager moving rapidly through shrubs on the ground and sometimes in taller trees during the winter 3  feeding birds often twitch their tails or flick their wings nervously 12  the observed feeding rate of the male wilsons warbler was not significantly different between males with or without mates 13  it also eats a few berries 2 breeding edit nesting generally begins in early march in west coast populations and extends into august in the northern range 3  the female does the majority of the nest buildingthe cup nest is typically constructed of vegetation and lined with grasses and hair it is often sunken into moss or sedges at the base of shrubs 3  the clutch varies from 2 to 7 eggs which are creamy or off white with fine reddish spots the young are altricial 2  the montane populations generally have a higher clutch size and nest success rate than those on the coast 3  the eggs hatch at 11–15 days and the young fledge at 8–13 days adults care for them for several weekssome montane populations are polygamous one male breeds with multiple females 3 wilsons warbler is a frequent host for the brown headed cowbird 3 references edit  birdlife

worm eating warbler   wikipedia the worm eating warbler helmitheros vermivorum is a small new world warbler that breeds in the eastern united states and migrates to southern mexico and central america for the wintertaxonomy edit the worm eating warbler is the only species currently classified in the genus helmitheros 3  however swainsons warbler has previously been in this genus as h swainsonii 4 description edit the worm eating warbler is a small new world warbler it is 13 cm 51 in long and weighs 13 g 046 oz it is relatively plain with olive brown upperparts and light coloured underparts but has black and light brown stripes on its head it has a slim pointed bill and pink legs in immature birds the head stripes are brownish the males song is a short high pitched trill this birds call is a chip or tseet worm eating warblers are sexually monomorphic 5  males and females can only reliably be sexed during the breeding season by the presence of a brood patch in females or a cloacal protuberance in males these birds are also difficult to age hatch yearsecond year birds have rusty tips on tertials that wear off by march of the following year juveniles can be distinguished by duskier head markings and cinnamon wingbarsreproduction edit this bird breeds in dense deciduous forests in the eastern united states usually on wooded slopes the nest is an open cup placed on the ground hidden among dead leaves it is one of five species of new world warblers that nests on the ground including the black and white warbler mniotilta varia the ovenbird seiurus aurocapilla the northern waterthrush parkesia noveboracensis louisiana waterthrush parkesia motacilla and the kentucky warbler geothlypis formosa the female lays four or five eggs both parents feed the young they may try to distract predators near the nest by pretending to be injured worm eating warblers are often parasitized by brown headed cowbirds molothrus ater where forest fragmentation occurs 6  reducing forest fragmentation may prove vital if populations of worm eating warblers suffer large declineshabitat and distribution edit these birds breed in the eastern united states their selected habitats vary significantly between populations 7  in much of their range worm eating warblers are associated with mature hardwood forests on steep slopes however recent attention has been focused on coastal breeding populations as little is known about their ecology or status historically coastal populations would select for pocosin ecosystems more recently however these populations have shifted to frequent use of pine plantations current use of pine plantations has resulted in densities higher than in areas previously thought to be their natural habitat this shift in habitat selection likely demonstrates that worm eating warblers are more closely associated with shrub structure than stand age or size if this is the case the landscape changes that occurred on the atlantic coastal plain may have had less of an impact on these birds than previously described maintaining this species habitat may require managing for dense shrubby midstory and understory due to their reliance on shrub structure for foraging and ground nesting behavior frequent fires have a negative impact on this species 8  other management strategies that reduce the shrub mid story increase herbaceous growth and decrease canopy cover are likely to have a similar effect more information is needed about their breeding habits in coastal regions as these forests are likely to represent different conditions from their inland counterparts 9  fat deposits play a key role in allowing for long distance migration in most passerines stopover habitat or areas that allow birds to replenish their fat stores are also critical 10 in winter these birds migrate to southern mexico the greater antilles and central america particularly along the caribbean slope where they occupy both scrub and moist forests 11  worm eating warblers have disappeared from some parts of their range due to habitat loss but their ability to use both scrub and moist forest ecosystems may be beneficial to the long term conservation of this species 12 feeding edit the diet of worm eating warblers varies across habitat types  13  this variation can be attributed to different predator avoidance strategies employed by common prey items on their breeding grounds worm eating warblers glean mostly from live foliage searching for arthropods on the wintering grounds this species gleans insects almost exclusively from dead plant material the name worm eating refers to the numerous lepidopteran larvae that this species consumes they rarely if ever eat earthwormsuse of pesticides especially those broadcast over a wide area is likely to have an effect on most insectivorous songbird species including the worm eating warbler 14  these pesticides decrease the species primary food source and could result in long term toxicityreferences

american yellow warbler   wikipedia yellow warbler redirects here for the yellow warbler genus in the acrocephalidae see chloropetathe american yellow warbler setophaga petechia formerly dendroica petechia is a new world warbler species sensu lato they make up the most widespread species in the diverse setophaga genus breeding in almost the whole of north america and down to northern south americaetymology edit the genus name setophaga is from ancient greek ses moth and phagos eating and the specific petechia is from italian petecchia a small red spot on the skin 2 description and taxonomy edit other than in male breeding plumage and body size all subspecies are very similar winter female and immature birds all have similarly greenish yellow uppersides and are a duller yellow below young males soon acquire breast and where appropriate head coloration females are somewhat duller most notably on the head in all the remiges and rectrices are blackish olive with yellow edges sometimes appearing as an indistinct wing band on the former the eyes and the short thin beak are dark while the feet are lighter or darker olive buff 3  4 the 35 subspecies of d petechia sensu lato can be divided into three main groups according to the males head color in the breeding season 4  each of these groups is sometimes considered a separate species or the aestiva group yellow warbler is considered a species different from d petechia mangrove warbler including golden warbler the latter option is the one currently accepted by the international ornithological congress world bird list 5 depending on subspecies the american yellow warbler may be between 10–18 cm 39–71 in long with a wingspan from 16 to 22 cm 63 to 87 in they weigh 7–25 g 025–088 oz varying between subspecies and whether on migration or not globally averaging about 16 g 056 oz but only 9–10 g 032–035 oz in most breeding adults of the united states populations among standard measurements throughout the subspecies the wing chord is 55 to 7 cm 22 to 28 in the tail is 39 to 56 cm 15 to 22 in the bill is 08 to 13 cm 031 to 051 in and the tarsus is 17 to 22 cm 067 to 087 in 4  the summer males of this species are generally the yellowest warblers wherever they occur they are brilliant yellow below and greenish golden above there are usually a few wide somewhat washed out rusty red streaks on the breast and flanks these markings are scientific namesake of the species since petechia roughly translates to liver spotted of which the reddish markings of the male were apparently reminiscent of for ornithologists 6  the various subspecies in this group mostly in brightness and size as per bergmanns and glogers rule 7 the golden warbler petechia group 17 subspecies 4  is generally resident in the mangrove swamps of the west indies local seasonal migrations may occur on the cayman islands for example d p eoa was found to be decidedly scarce on grand cayman and apparently absent from cayman brac in november 1979 while it had been a very common breeder in the group some 10 years before and not frequently seen in the winters of 19721973 apparently the birds disperse elsewhere outside the breeding season the cuban golden warbler d p gundlachi barely reaches the florida keys where it was first noted in 1941 and by the mid 20th century a breeding population was resident 8  though individual birds may stray farther north their distribution is restricted by the absence of mangrove habitatthey are generally smallish usually weighing about 10 g 035 oz or less and sometimes 9  as little as 65 g 023 oz the summer males differs from those of the yellow warbler in that they have a rufous crown hood or mask the races in this group vary in the extent and hue of the head patchthe mangrove warbler erithachorides group 12 subspecies 4  tends to be larger than other yellow warbler subspecies groups averaging 125 cm 49 in in length and 11 g 039 oz in weight it is resident in the mangrove swamps of coastal middle america and northern south america d p aureola is found on the oceanic galápagos islands 4  the summer males differ from those of the yellow warbler in that they have a rufous hood or crown the races in this group vary in the extent and hue of the hood overlapping extensively with the golden warbler group in this character 4 the american yellow warbler aestiva group 6 subspecies 4  breeds in the whole of temperate north america as far south as central mexico in open often wet woods or shrub it is migratory wintering in central and south america they are very rare vagrants to western europe 3 vocalizations edit the song is a musical strophe that can be rendered sweet sweet sweet im so sweet although it varies considerably between populations the call is a soft or harder chip or ship this is particularly frequently given by females after a male has finished his song in territorial defence they give hissing calls while seet seems to be a kind of specialized cowbird alert see below other calls are given in communication between pair members neighbors or by young begging for food these birds also communicate with postures and perhaps with touch 3 ecology edit male above and female yellow warblers foraging in a reedbed mill creek streamway park kansas united statesamerican yellow warblers breed in most of north america from the tundra southwards but they do not range far southwestwards and avoid the gulf of mexico coasts also 3  the mangrove and golden warblers occur to the south of it to the northern reaches of the andes american yellow warblers winter to the south of their breeding range from southern california to the amazon region bolivia and peru 3 american yellow warblers arrive in their breeding range in late spring – generally about aprilmay – and move to winter quarters again starting as early as july as soon as the young are fledged most however stay a bit longer by the end of august the bulk of the northern populations has moved south though some may linger almost until fall at least in northern ohio yellow warblers do not seem to remain on their breeding grounds longer than they did 100 years ago 10 the breeding habitat of american yellow warblers is typically riparian or otherwise moist land with ample growth of small trees in particular willows salix the other groups as well as wintering birds chiefly inhabit mangrove swamps and similar dense woody growth less preferred habitat are shrubland farmlands and forest edges in particular american yellow warblers will come to suburban or less densely settled areas orchards and parks and may well breed there outside the breeding season these warblers are usually encountered in small groups but while breeding they are fiercely territorial and will try to chase away any conspecific intruder that comes along 3 these birds feed mainly on arthropods in particular insects they acquire prey by gleaning in shrubs and on tree branches and by hawking prey that tries to fly away other invertebrates and some berries and similar small juicy fruits 11  are also eaten the latter especially by american yellow warblers in their winter quarters the yellow warbler is one of several insectivorous bird species that reduce the number of coffee berry borer beetles in costa rica coffee plantations by 50 caterpillars are the staple food for nestlings with some – eg those of geometer moths geometridae – preferred over others 12 the predators of yellow and mangrove warblers are those typical of such smallish tree nesting passerines the odds of an adult american yellow warbler to survive from one year to the next are on average 50 in the southern populations by contrast about two thirds of the adults survive each year conversely less than one american yellow warbler nest in three on average suffers from predation in one way or another while two out of three mangrove and golden warbler nests are affected 13 snakes 14  corvids 15  and large climbing rodents 16  are significant nest predators carnivores in particular musteloidea 17  as well as the red fox vulpes vulpes and domestic or feral cats prey on nestlings and fledglings as well as sick or distracted adults these predators pose little threat to the nimble non nesting adults but certain smallish and agile birds of prey do especially the american kestrel falco sparverius as well as coopers hawk accipiter cooperii and the sharp shinned hawk a striatus other avian predators of adults have included peregrine falcons falco peregrinus and merlins falco columbarius owls such as great horned owls bubo virginianus and eastern screech owls megascops asio have been known to assault yellow warblers of all ages during night 3  18 these new world warblers seem to mob predators only rarely an exception are cowbirds which are significant brood parasites the yellow warbler is a regular host of the brown headed cowbird molothrus ater with about 40 of all nests suffering attempted or successful parasitism by contrast the tropical populations are host to the shiny cowbird m bonariensis but less than one nest in 10 is affected this may be due to the slightly larger size of shiny cowbirds which are less likely to survive being feed by the much smaller warbler compared to brown headed cowbirds 18  the yellow warbler is one of the few passerine proven to be able to recognize the presence of cowbird eggs in its nest 18  upon recognizing a cowbird egg in its nest the warbler will often smother it with a new layer of nesting material it will usually not try to save any of its own eggs that have already been laid but produce a replacement clutch sometimes the parents desert a parasitized nest altogether and build a new one unlike some cuckoos cowbird nestlings will not actively kill the nestlings of the host bird mixed broods of setophaga and molothrus may fledge successfully 13  however success of fledging in yellow warbler nests is usually decreased by the parasitism of cowbirds due to the pressures of raising a much larger bird 18 other than due to predation mortality reasons are not well known the maximum recorded ages 19  of wild yellow warblers are around 10 years a wintering american yellow warbler examined near turbo colombia was not infected with blood parasites unlike other species in the study it is unclear whether this significant but wintering birds in that region generally lacked such parasites 20 breeding edit yellow warbler nest with small clutchas usual for new world warblers parulidae they nest in trees building a small but very sturdy cup nest females and males share the reproductive work about equally but emphasize different tasks females are more involved with building and maintaining the nest and incubating and brooding the offspring most of the actual feeding is also done by them males are more involved in guarding the nest site and procuring food bringing it to the nest and passing it to the waiting mother as the young approach fledging the males workload becomes proportionally higher 3 the american yellow and mangrove including golden warblers differ in some other reproductive parameters while the former is somewhat more of an r strategist the actual differences are complex and adapted to different environmental conditions the yellow warbler starts breeding in mayjune while the mangrove warbler can be found breeding all year round american yellow warblers have been known to raise a brood of young in as little as 45 days but usually take about 75 days the tropical populations by contrast need more than 100 days per breeding males court the females with songs an american yellow warbler has been observed to sing more than 3200 songs in one day they are like most songbirds generally serially monogamous some 10 of mangrove warbler and about half as many american yellow marbler males are bigamous very few if any american yellow warblers breed more than once per year around one in twenty mangrove warbler females will do so however if a breeding attempt fails either will usually try and raise a second brood successfully though 13 the clutch of the american yellow warbler is 3–6 typically 4–5 rarely 1–2 eggs incubation to hatching usually takes 11 days but may take up to two weeks the nestlings weigh 13 g 0046 oz on average and are brooded for an average 8–9 days after hatching and leave the nest the following day or the one thereafter mangrove warblers on the other hand have only 3 eggs per clutch on average and incubate some 2 days longer its average post hatching brooding time is 11 days almost half of the parents somewhat more in the mangrove warbler somewhat less in the american yellow warbler attend the fledglings for some time after these leave the nest this post fledging care can extend for two additional weeks or more and sometimes the pairs separate early each accompanied by one to three of the young 21 some 3–4 weeks after hatching the young are fully independent of their parents they become sexually mature at one year of age and attempt to breed right away only about one in four mangrove warbler nests successfully fledge any offspring due to accidents and predation frequently causing total loss of the clutch by contrast 55 of all american yellow warbler nestings are successful in raising at least one young 21 status and conservation edit to humans these birds are quite beneficial for one thing in particular the young devour many pest insects during the breeding season for another the plumage and song of the breeding males have been described 3  as lovely and musical and they can help to generate revenue from ecotourism no significant negative effects of american yellow and mangrove warblers on humans have been recorded 3 these birds are generally common and occur over a wide range consequently the iucn 22  does not consider them a threatened species a local decline in numbers has been noted here and there this is generally due to habitat destruction and pollution mainly by land clearance and herbicide and pesticide overuse of agriculture and sometimes overgrazing however especially american yellow warblers are prolific and the stocks will usually rebound quickly if riparian habitat is allowed to recover 1  3 the north american populations are legally protected by the migratory bird

louisiana waterthrush   wikipedia the louisiana waterthrush parkesia motacilla 2  is a new world warbler that breeds in eastern north america and winters in the west indies and central america plain brown above it is white below with black streaks and with buff flanks and undertail distinguishing it from the closely related northern waterthrush the habitats it prefers are streams and their surroundings and other wet areasit breeds in eastern north america from southernmost canada and south through the eastern united states excluding florida and the coast the louisiana waterthrush is migratory wintering in central america and the west indies this is a rare vagrant to the western united states they are one of the earlier neotropical migrants to return to their breeding grounds in the spring often completing their migration in late march or early april which is almost two months before most other warblers reach their breeding grounds they are also one of the earliest warblers to vacate their breeding grounds with some departing as early as july almost all will have left by late augustdescription edit the louisiana waterthrush has a plain brown back and white underparts streaked with black the flanks and undertail are buff there is a strong white flared supercilium and the legs are bright pink all plumages are similar but young birds have buff underparts rather than white the main confusion species is the closely related northern waterthrush parkesia noveboracensis 2  which has white flanks and undertail a striped throat a slightly smaller bill a shorter supercilium and duller pink legsin a study of the two waterthrushes in connecticut nesting grounds the louisiana waterthrush at an average of 206 g 073 oz was rather larger than the northern at an average of 162 g 057 oz 3  the louisiana waterthrush is one of the largest species of wood warbler with only the aberrant yellow breasted chat averaging larger in mean mass and linear measurements it measures 14–17 cm 55–67 in in length and spanning 21–254 cm 83–100 in across the wings 4  5  the weight of adult birds can vary from 174 to 28 g 061 to 099 oz among standard measurements the wing chord is 74 to 85 cm 29 to 33 in the tail 44 to 54 cm 17 to 21 in the bill is 12 to 15 cm 047 to 059 in and the tarsus is 2 to 23 cm 079 to 091 in 6 the males song is a musical distinctive series of descending notes followed by a warble the pitch of the beginning notes of the louisianas song usually descend just as does the hilly stream that is its preferred habitat whereas in the northern waterthrush the song does not vary in pitch as much the call is a hard chinklike the closely related northern waterthrush the louisiana waterthrush frequently bobs its tailat brighton dam in maryland usaecology edit the male louisiana waterthrush does not sing on its wintering grounds before it leaves it sings immediately when it arrives on its breeding territory whether it begins singing during migration is not known when establishing his territory a male sings vigorously nearly all day after he acquires a mate singing decreases quickly and he concentrates his singing into the morning hours the breeding habitat is wet woodlands near running water and does not occur outside such areas as a breeder however during winter the louisiana waterthrush mainly forages along flooded roads or trails and in parks lawns and gardens rarely entering true forest even forested wetlands in the subtropics 7  the northern waterthrush prefers stagnant swampy waters and is generally a more terrestrial forager louisiana waterthrushes prefer dense vegetation along the waters edge for nesting since this provides the main protection of nest from predation louisiana waterthrushes nest in a rock crevice mud bank or amongst tree roots laying 4–6 eggs in a cup nest from late may to mid june both parents construct the nest which is built from wet muddy leaves pine needles grass and small twigs the female louisiana waterthrush incubates the eggs for 12 or 13 days the fledging period lasts for 9 or 10 days with both adults feeding the young for a further 4 weeks 8 they are one of a few passerine species that does most of its foraging in actively running water which only the dippers are known for at the family level mostly they depend on aquatic insects molluscs and crustaceans occasionally ground based insects such as beetles and ants are taken as well as flying insects such as flies which may be hawked on the wing alternately they forage amongst the leaf litter in circumstances where the insect prey is low louisiana waterthrushes can target prey as large as salamanders and small fish 9 less common and widespread today than it was two centuries ago the louisiana waterthrushs decline is mainly due to the reduction of suitable habitat through clearing and channelization of streams as well as pollution and the impounding of rivers and streams to create reservoirs 10  additionally because the louisiana waterthrush is dependent on large areas of continuous forest this species is likely to be threatened by increasing forest fragmentation timber harvesting agriculture urban development and gas drilling may further reduce the available habitat for this species 7  the population seems be quite extremely sensitive to changes in habitat quality and quantity threats to the canadian population of this species include reduced insect prey and reductions in water supply due to agricultural drainage excessive irrigation and climate change as well as logging and habitat

bohemian waxwing   wikipedia bombycilla garrulus in ontario canadathe bohemian waxwing bombycilla garrulus is a starling sized passerine bird that breeds in the northern forests of eurasia and north america it has mainly buff grey plumage black face markings and a pointed crest its wings are patterned with white and bright yellow and some feather tips have the red waxy appearance that give this species its english name the three subspecies show only minor differences in appearance females are similar to males although young birds are less well marked and have few or no waxy wingtips although the bohemian waxwings range overlaps those of the cedar and japanese waxwings it is easily distinguished from them by size and plumage differencesthe breeding habitat is coniferous forests usually near water the pair build a lined cup shaped nest in a tree or bush often close to the trunk the clutch of 3–7 eggs is incubated by the female alone for 13–14 days to hatching the chicks are altricial and naked and are fed by both parents initially mostly with insects but thereafter mainly fruit they fledge about 14–16 days after leaving the egg many birds desert their nesting range in winter and migrate farther south in some years large numbers of bohemian waxwings irrupt well beyond their normal winter range in search of the fruit that makes up most of their dietwaxwings can be very tame in winter entering towns and gardens in search of food rowan berries being a particular favourite they can metabolise alcohol produced in fermenting fruit but can still become intoxicated sometimes fatally other hazards include predation by birds of prey infestation by parasites and collisions with cars or windows the bohemian waxwings high numbers and very large breeding area mean that it is classified as being of least concern by the international union for conservation of naturetaxonomy edit the waxwings are a family bombycillidae of short tailed stocky birds with soft plumage a head crest and distinctively patterned wings and tails there are three species the bohemian cedar and japanese waxwings dna studies and shared features such as a relatively large size grey underparts and similar undertail patterns suggest that the japanese and bohemian waxwings are most closely related within the genus although only the cedar and bohemian waxwings normally have red tips on their wing feathers this feature is occasionally shown by the japanese waxwing suggesting that this was originally a whole family characteristic that has been lost in one species rather than an indicator of a close relationship dna analysis confirms that the cedar waxwing diverged early from the other members of the family outside the genus the closest relatives of the waxwings are believed to be the silky flycatchers the palmchat and the grey hypocolius all of which have sometimes been included in the bombycillidae 2 the bohemian waxwing was described by linnaeus in his systema naturae in 1758 as lanius garrulus 3  the waxwings were moved to their own genus bombycilla by vieillot in 1808 4  a  the genus name bombycilla comes from the greek bombux silk and the modern latin cilla tail 7  this is a direct translation of the german seidenschwanz silk tail and refers to the silky soft plumage of the bird 8  the species name garrulus is the latin for talkative and was applied to this bird as garrulus bohemicus by conrad gessner in 1555 9  10  the term is a reference to a supposed likeness to the eurasian jay garrulus glandarius rather than to the waxwings vocalisations 11  the english name waxwing refers to the bright red tips of the secondary feathers on its wings which look like drops of sealing wax while bohemian follows gessners usage and may refer to the romani alluding to the birds wanderings 8  or to its presumed origin from bohemia 12  waxwing and bohemian waxwing were first recorded in 1817 the former as a reference to vieillots separation of this bird from the chatterers 13 there are three recognised subspecies 14 b g garrulus linnaeus 1758 the nominate subspecies breeds in northern europe from northern sweden east to the ural mountainsb g centralasiae poliakov 1915 breeds from the urals eastwards across northern asia 15 b g pallidiceps reichenow 1908 breeds in northwestern north america 16 the differences between these forms are small and clinal and the species could be possibly considered as monotypic 2  the fossil record includes pleistocene deposits from the uk and the carpathian mountains 17  18 description edit the distinctive red wing tipsthe bohemian waxwing is a starling sized bird 19–23 cm 75–91 in in length with a 32–355 cm 126–140 in wingspan and an average weight of 55 g 19 oz 14  it is short tailed mainly brownish grey and has a conspicuous crest on its head the male of the nominate subspecies has a black mask through the eye and a black throat there is a white streak behind the bill and a white curve below the eye the lower belly is a rich chestnut colour and there are cinnamon coloured areas around the mask the rump is grey and the tail ends in a bright yellow band with a broad black border above it the wings are very distinctive the flight feathers are black and the primaries have markings that produce a yellow stripe and white fishhooks on the closed wing the adults secondaries end in long red appendages with the sealing wax appearance that gives the bird its english name the eyes are dark brown the bill is mainly black and the legs are dark grey or black 14  in flight the waxwings large flocks long wings and short tail give some resemblance to the common starling and its flight is similarly fast and direct 2  it clambers easily through bushes and trees but only shuffles on the ground 19 the soft dense feathers are kept in good condition by preening 2  the red waxy tips are the extended and flattened ends of feather shafts pigmented with astaxanthin and enclosed in a transparent sheath a study of the cedar waxwings showed that the red tips are few or absent until the third year of life for that related species 20  all adult waxwings have a complete moult annually between august and january juveniles moult at the same time but retain their flight and some other wing feathers 2 the female bohemian waxwing is very similar to the male but has a narrower yellow terminal band to the tail a less defined lower edge to the black throat and slightly less distinctive wing markings juveniles are duller than adults with whiter underparts only a few red wing tips no black on the throat and a smaller black face mask compared to the nominate subspecies eastern b g centralasiae is paler greyer and has little reddish brown behind the bill the american subspecies b g pallidiceps has more colouring on the cheeks and forehead than the nominate form and is otherwise generally duller in appearance 14 the range of the bohemian waxwing overlaps those of both the other members of the genus the cedar waxwing is smaller than the bohemian it has browner upperparts a white undertail and a white line above the black eye patch adult cedar waxwings have a yellowish belly and all ages have less strongly patterned wings than the bohemian waxwing 19  the japanese waxwing is easily distinguished from its relatives it has a red terminal band to the tail the black mask extends up the rear of the crest and there is no yellow stripe or red tips on the wings 21 the bohemian waxwings call is a high trill sirrrr it is less wavering and lower pitched than that of the cedar waxwing 19  22  and longer and lower pitched than the call of the japanese waxwing 21  other calls are just variants of the main vocalisation a quieter version is used by chicks to call parents and courtship calls also given during nest construction have a particularly large frequency range 23  although not a call as such when a flock takes off or lands the wings make a distinctive rattling sound that can be heard 30 m 98 ft away 19 distribution and habitat edit northern coniferous forest breeding habitatthe bohemian waxwing has a circumpolar distribution breeding in northern regions of eurasia and north america in eurasia its northern nesting limit is just short of the treeline roughly at the 10 °c july isotherm and it breeds south locally to about 51°n 19  most birds breed between 60–67°n reaching 70°n in scandinavia 24  the north american subspecies breeds in the northwestern and north central areas of the continent its range extending southwards beyond the us border in the rocky mountains 1  22 this waxwing is migratory with much of the breeding range abandoned as the birds move south for the winter migration starts in september in the north of the range a month or so later farther south eurasian birds normally winter from eastern britain through northern parts of western and central europe ukraine kazakhstan and northern china to japan north american breeders have a more southeasterly trend many birds wintering in southeast canada with smaller numbers in the north central and northeastern us states birds do not usually return to the same wintering sites in successive years 14  one bird wintering in the ukraine was found 6000 km 3700 mi to the east in siberia in the following year 19  25 in some years this waxwing irrupts south of its normal wintering areas sometimes in huge numbers the fruit on which the birds depend in winter varies in abundance from year to year and in poor years particularly those following a good crop the previous year the flocks move farther south until they reach adequate supplies 26  27  they will stay until the food runs out and move on again 28  in what may be the largest ever irruption in europe in the winter of 2004–2005 more than half a million waxwings were recorded in germany alone this invasion followed an unusually warm dry breeding season 24  in 1908 an american flock 60–90 m 200–300 ft wide was noted as taking two to three minutes to fly over 14 the breeding habitat is mature conifers often spruce although other conifers and broadleaf trees may also be present more open wet areas such as lakes and peat swamps with dead and drowned trees are used for feeding on insects lowlands valleys and uplands are used in eurasia although mountains tend to be avoided however the north american subspecies nests in canada at altitudes between 900–1550 m 2950–5090 ft 19  29  outside the breeding season the waxwing will occupy a wide range of habitats as long as suitable fruits such as rowan are available it may be found by roads in parks and gardens or along hedges or woodlands edges it shows little fear of humans at this time 14  19  in winter waxwings roost communally in dense trees or hedges sometimes with american robins fieldfares or other wintering species 2 behaviour edit breeding edit bohemian waxwings start their return from the wintering grounds in february or march but northern breeders do not reach their breeding areas until april or early may this monogamous species nests mainly from mid june to july 19 waxwings are not highly territorial and although normally solitary breeders several pairs may nest close together where there are a number of good nest sites 2  males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates and females may squabble over nest sites aggression is shown by sleeking down the feathers and crest showing the black throat and opening the bill the breeding display is almost the opposite of this the male erects his body and crest feathers and turns his head away from the female the male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item often food to his partner placing it in her open bill in about 90 of cases this display does not lead to copulation 30  older males have more red tips to the wings and are preferred by females 23 the nest built by both sexes is a cup of thin twigs lined with softer material such as fine grass moss fur or lichen it is constructed 13–15 m 4–50 ft above the ground in a pine or scrub commonly close to the trunk the eggs are a glossy pale blue spotted with black and grey and the clutch is 3–7 eggs although five or six is most common 14  19  the average size of the egg is 24 mm × 18 mm 094 in × 071 in and it weighs 38 g 013 oz of which 5 is shell the eggs are incubated for 13–14 days by the female alone 17  she is fed regurgitated berries by her mate and rarely leaves the nest the chicks are altricial and naked and have bright red mouths they are fed by both parents although the male brings most of the food mainly insects in the first few days the young are subsequently fed largely with fruit the chicks fledge about 14–16 days after hatching 2  they are fed by the adults for about two weeks after fledging 23 breeding densities of this waxwing are typically low compared to other passerines usually less than ten birds per square kilometre 26 per square mile even in good habitat although up to 35·6 birds per square kilometre 92 per square mile have been found in russia 2  one brood each year is normal 17  maximum recorded ages are 5 years 10 months in north america and more than 13 years 6 months in europe 23  31  the average life expectancy is unknown 17  significant causes of death include predation 23  collisions with windows and cars 2  and poisoning by road salt consumed when drinking 32 feeding edit waxwings are primarily fruit eaters but also consume insects during the breeding season mosquitoes and midges are the most common prey but many other insects and some spiders are eaten they are caught mainly by flycatching from an open perch but some may be picked off vegetation 19  fruit is normally picked from trees sometimes from the ground and is usually swallowed whole in the summer vaccinium and rubus species and canada buffaloberry are important items of their diet while cotoneaster juniper haws rose hips and apples predominate outside the breeding season rowan berries are a favourite food and are eaten whenever available 14 waxwings can eat huge numbers of berries each bird sometimes consuming several hundred a day more than double its own weight one individual was recorded as eating between 600 and 1000 cotoneaster berries in six hours and defecating every four minutes 12  waxwings travel significant distances when feeding and help to disperse the fruit seeds 2  waxwings forage in large flocks sometimes of several hundred birds which enables them to overwhelm birds such as mistle thrushes attempting to defend their fruit trees 33 fruit is rich in sugar but deficient in other nutrients so it must be eaten in large quantities 2  bohemian waxwings have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy they can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans but may still become intoxicated 23  34  sometimes fatally 23  waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect in the summer the fruits are juicier and water is less of a problem 2 in the past the arrival of waxwings sometimes coincided with epidemics of cholera or plague and led to the old dutch and flemish name pestvogel plague bird the juniper berries on which they fed were thought to offer protection and people consumed the fruit and burned branches to fumigate their houses 24 predators and parasites edit waxwings are preyed upon by birds of prey including rough legged buzzards eurasian sparrowhawks prairie falcons 23  and great grey shrikes 35  merlins attack winter flocks including those in cities 36  when alarmed bohemian waxwings freeze with bill and neck pointing upwards if this fails they fly calling noisily 23 bohemian waxwings are not brood parasitised by the common cuckoo or its relatives in eurasia because the cuckoos young cannot survive on a largely fruit diet in north america the waxwings breeding range has little overlap with brown headed cowbird another parasitic species nevertheless eggs of other birds placed in a bohemian waxwings nest are always rejected this suggests that in the past perhaps 3 million years ago the ancestral waxwing was a host of a brood parasitic species and retains the rejection behaviour acquired then 37 parasitic mites include syringophiloidus bombycillae first identified on this species 38  and the nasal mite ptilonyssus bombycillae 39  blood parasites include trypanosoma species and a leucocytozoon first identified in this waxwing 40  bohemian waxwings may carry flatworms and tapeworms but levels of parasitic worm infestation are generally low 41 the global population of the bohemian waxwing has been estimated at more than three million birds and the breeding range covers about 128 million km2 49 million mi2 although this species population as of 2013 appears to be declining the decrease is not rapid nor large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria given its high numbers and huge breeding area this waxwing is therefore classified by the international union for conservation of nature as being of least concern 1  42  the woodlands used by this species are well to the north of major human populations and the birds can use disturbed habitats so there are no serious long term threats to this species 14  the apparent discrepancy between vieillots book publication date 1807 and the date of the genus attribution in standard sources 1808 5  arises because the book was published in monthly installments over a two year period between 1807 and 1809 6 references edit  a b c birdlife international 2012 bombycilla garrulus iucn red list of threatened species version 20132 international union

cedar waxwing   wikipedia the cedar waxwing bombycilla cedrorum is a member of the family bombycillidae or waxwing family of passerine birds it is a medium sized mostly brown gray and yellow bird named for its wax like wing tips it is a native of north and central america breeding in open wooded areas in southern canada and wintering in the southern half of the united states central america and the far northwest of south america its diet includes cedar cones fruit and insects 2  the cedar waxwing is not endangeredthe genus name bombycilla comes from the ancient greek bombux silk and the modern latin cilla tail 3  this is a direct translation of the german seidenschwanz silk tail and refers to the silky soft plumage of these birds 4  the specific cedrorum is latin for of the cedars 3 description edit cedar waxwings are a medium sized bird approximately 6–7 in 15–18 cm long and weigh roughly 30 g 11 oz they are smaller and more brown than their close relative the bohemian waxwing which breeds farther to the north and west it is a silky shiny collection of brown gray and lemon yellow accented with a subdued crest rakish black mask and brilliant red wax droplets on the wing feathers 5  these droplets may be the same color as the madrone berries they are known to eat 6  these birds most prominent feature is this small cluster of red wax like droplets on tips of secondary flight feathers on the wings a feature they share with the bohemian waxwing but not the japanese waxwing the wings are broad and pointed like a starlings 5  the tail is typically yellow or orange depending on diet birds that have fed on berries of introduced eurasian honeysuckles while growing tail feathers will have darker orange tipped tail feathers 7  the tail is somewhat short and square tipped 5  adults have a pale yellow belly the waxwings crest often lies flat and droops over the back of the head 5  it has a short and wide bill 5  the waxwings black mask has a thin white border immature birds are streaked on the throat and flanks and often do not have the black mask of the adults males and females look alike 8 the flight of waxwings is strong and direct and the movement of the flock in flight resembles that of a flock of small pale european starlings cedar waxwings fly at 40 kmh 25 mph and fly at an altitude of 610 m 2000 ftcedar waxwings are also known as the southern waxwing canada robin cedar bird cherry bird or recelletthe oldest observed cedar waxwing was eight years and two months old 7 vocalizations edit the two common calls of these birds include very high pitched whistles and buzzy trills about a half second long often represented as see or sree 7  9  its call can also be described as high thin whistles 5  they call often especially in flight 7 distribution and habitat edit preferred habitat consists of trees at the edge of wooded areas or open forests especially those that provide access to berry sources as well as water they are frequently seen in fruiting trees 5  waxwings are attracted to the sound of running water and love to bathe in and drink from shallow creeks in urban or suburban environments waxwings often favor parkland with well spaced trees golf courses cemeteries or other landscaping with well spaced trees bushes that provide berries and a nearby water source such as a fountain or birdbath also look for them near farms orchards and gardens particularly ones with fruiting trees or shrubs 5 outside the breeding season cedar waxwings often feed in large flocks numbering hundreds of birds this species is nomadic and irruptive 10  with erratic winter movements though most of the population migrates farther south into the united states and beyond sometimes reaching as far as northern south america they will move in huge numbers if berry supplies are low rare vagrants have reached western europe and there are two recorded occurrences of cedar waxwing sightings in great britain individual bohemian waxwings will occasionally join large winter flocks of cedar waxwingsbehavior and ecology edit cedar waxwings are sociable seen in flocks year round 5  they are non territorial birds and will often groom each other 8  they move from place to place depending on where they can find good sources of berries 8 breeding edit mating season for this bird begins around the end of spring and runs through late summer 8  the male will do a hopping dance for the female if she is interested shell hop back 8  during courtship the male and female will sit together and pass small objects back and forth such as flower petals or an insect mating pairs will sometimes rub their beaks together affectionately the nest is a loose open cup built with grass and twigs lined with softer materials and supported by a tree branch averaging 2 to 6 m 66 to 197 ft above ground but at times considerably higher it takes around five or six days for the female waxwing to build the nest and can take up to 2500 trips back and forth sometimes the female will steal nest material from other species nests to save time 7  the outer diameter of the nest is approximately 12 to 16 cm 47 to 63 in usually 5 or 6 eggs are laid and the female incubates them for 11 to 13 days 7  the eggs are oval shaped with a smooth surface and very little if any gloss the egg shells are of various shades of light or bluish grey with irregular dark brown spots or greyish brown splotches 7  both parents build the nest and feed the young typically there are one or two broods during the mating season 7  young leave the nest about 14 to 18 days after hatching 7 red wax on wing tips visiblethe cedar waxwing eats berries and sugary fruit year round including dogwood serviceberry cedar juniper hawthorn and winterberry 5  with insects becoming an important part of the diet in the breeding season its fondness for the small cones of the eastern redcedar a kind of juniper gave this bird its common name they eat berries whole 5  they sometimes fly over water to catch insects 5 when the end of a twig holds a supply of berries that only one bird at a time can reach members of a flock may line up along the twig and pass berries beak to beak down the line so that each bird gets a chance to eat 11 sometimes cedar waxwings will eat fruit that is overripe and has begun to ferment intoxicating the bird 7 conservation status edit waxwings are evaluated as least concern on the iucn red list of endangered species 1  populations are increasing in their range partly because fields are being allowed to grow into forests and shrublands and fruiting trees like mountain ash are being planted as landscaping 7  on the other hand cedar waxwings do sometimes crash into windows and get hit by cars while foraging along roadsides 7 references

pileated woodpecker   wikipedia the pileated woodpecker dryocopus pileatus is a large woodpecker native to north america roughly crow sized it normally inhabits deciduous forests in eastern north america the great lakes the boreal forests of canada and parts of the pacific coast it is the second largest woodpecker in the united states after the critically endangered and possibly extinct 2  ivory billed woodpeckerdescription edit adults are 40 to 49 cm 16 to 19 in long span 66 to 75 cm 26 to 30 in across the wings and weigh 250 to 400 g 88 to 141 oz with an average weight of 300 g 11 oz each wing measures 214 to 253 cm 84 to 100 in the tail measures 14 to 174 cm 55 to 69 in the bill is 41–6 cm 16–24 in and the tarsus measures 31–38 cm 12–15 in 3  they are mainly black with a red crest and have a white line down the sides of the throat they show white on the wings in flight the flight of these birds is strong and direct but has an undulating quality similar to the relatively unique flight style of all woodpeckers adult males have a red line from the bill to the throat in adult females these are black 4  two species found in the old world the white bellied and black woodpeckers are closely related and occupy the same ecological niche in their respective ranges that the pileated occupies in north america 3  the only north american birds of similar plumage and size are the ivory billed woodpecker of the southeastern united states and cuba and the related imperial woodpecker of mexico however unlike the pileated both of those species are extremely rare if not extinct most reports of the ivory billed woodpecker are believed to be erroneous reports of the far more common pileatedthe call is a loud far carrying laugh sometimes described as a jungle bird call due to its wild un fettered quality the northern flicker which is very different looking and weighs about half as much as a pileated has a similar sounding call but has a weaker voice its drumming can be very loud often sounding like someone striking a tree with a hammersubspecies edit up to four subspecies of pileated woodpeckers have been recognized historically however many authors only recognize two subspecies the southernly d p pileatus and the northerly d p abieticola and the differences between the other two subspecies other than range are not well described generally pileated woodpeckers follow bergmanns rule being smaller and more compact in the south pileatus and larger in the north abieticola the ranges of the potential four subspecies are described below 3  5 southern pileated woodpecker d p pileatus – the southeastern us except floridanorthern pileated woodpecker d p abieticola – distributed from the canadian prairies provinces east through eastern canada and the northern united statesflorida pileated woodpecker d p floridanus –the florida peninsula and florida keyswestern pileated woodpecker d p picinus – western north americadistribution and habitat edit their breeding habitat is forested areas across canada the eastern united states and parts of the pacific coast this bird favors mature forests and heavily wooded parks they specifically prefer mesic habitats with large mature hardwood trees often being found in large tracts of forest however they also inhabit smaller woodlots as long as they have a scattering of tall treesbehavior edit male excavating a nest holethese birds mainly eat insects especially carpenter ants and wood boring beetle larvae they also eat fruits nuts and berries including poison ivy berries 6  pileated woodpeckers will often chip out large and roughly rectangular holes in trees while searching out insects especially ant galleries 4  they also will lap up ants by reaching with their long tongue into crevices they are self assured on the vertical surfaces of large trees but can seem awkward while feeding on small branches and vines pileated woodpeckers may also forage on or near the ground especially around fallen dead trees which can contain a smorgasbord of insect life they may forage around the sides of human homes or even cars and can occasionally be attracted to suet type feeders although they are less likely feeder visitors than smaller woodpeckers pileateds may regularly be attracted to them in areas experiencing harsh winter conditionsusually pileated woodpeckers excavate their large nests in the cavities of dead trees woodpeckers make such large holes in dead trees that the holes can cause a small tree to break in half the roost of a pileated woodpecker usually has multiple entrance holes pileated woodpeckers raise their young every year in a hole in a tree in april the hole made by the male attracts a female for mating and raising their young once the brood is raised the pileated woodpeckers abandon the hole and will not use it the next year when abandoned these holes—made similarly by all woodpeckers—provide good homes in future years for many forest song birds and a wide variety of other animals owls and tree nesting ducks may largely rely on holes made by pileateds in which to lay their nests even mammals such as raccoons may use them other woodpeckers and smaller birds such as wrens may be attracted to pileated holes to feed on the insects found in them ecologically the entire woodpecker family is important to the well being of many other bird species the pileated woodpecker will also nest in nest boxes about 46 m 15 ft off the grounda pileated woodpecker pair stays together on its territory all year round and is a non migratory species it will defend the territory in all seasons but will tolerate floaters during the winter 7  when clashing with conspecifics they engage in much chasing calling striking with the wings and jabbing with the bill drumming is most commonly to proclaim a territory and hollow trees are often used to make the largest sound possiblepileated woodpeckers have been observed to move to another site if any eggs have fallen out of the nest—a rare habit in birds the cavity is unlined except for wood chips both parents incubate three to five eggs for 12 to 16 days there is an average of clutch size of 4 per nest the young may take a month to fledge 8  the oldest known pileated woodpecker was 12 years and 11 months old predators at the nest can include american martens weasels squirrels rat snakes and

red bellied woodpecker   wikipedia the red bellied woodpecker melanerpes carolinus is a medium sized woodpecker of the picidae family it breeds in southern canada northeastern mexico and the northeastern united states ranging as far south as florida and as far west as texas its common name is somewhat misleading as the most prominent red part of its plumage is on the head the red headed woodpecker however is another species that is a rather close relative but looks quite differentit was first described in linnaeus systema naturae as picus carolinus 2  the type locality is given simply as america septentrionalis north americadescription edit adult female – showing reddish bellyadults are mainly light gray on the face and underparts they have black and white barred patterns on their back wings and tail adult males have a red cap going from the bill to the nape females have a red patch on the nape and another above the bill the reddish tinge on the belly that gives the bird its name is difficult to see in field identification they are 2285 to 267 cm 900 to 1051 in long and have a wingspan of 38 to 46 cm 15 to 18 in 3 vocalizations edit red bellied woodpeckers are noisy birds and have many varied calls calls have been described as sounding like churr churr churr or thrraa thrraa thrraa with an alternating br r r r t sound males tend to call and drum more frequently than females but both sexes call often these woodpeckers drum to attract mates they tap on aluminum roofs metal guttering hollow trees and even transformer boxes in urban environments to communicate with potential partners babies have a high pitched begging call of pree pree pree they will continue to give a begging call whenever they see their parents for a while after fledgingthese birds mainly search out arthropods on tree trunks they may also catch insects in flight they are omnivores eating insects fruits nuts and seeds their breeding habitat is usually deciduous forests they nest in the decayed cavities of dead trees old stumps or in live trees that have softer wood such as elms maples or willows both sexes assist in digging nesting cavities areas around nest sites are marked with drilling holes to warn others awaythough the species is not globally threatened it depends on large trees for nesting in areas that are extensively deforested the birds will sometimes utilize gardens but for the most part simply will not be present in any numbers 4 a female red bellied woodpecker feeding her chickforaging edit red bellied woodpecker feeding on the ground central park new york usaas with all animals foraging becomes an important role in an animal’s ability to survive and reproduce the red bellied woodpecker expresses foraging behavior by catching or storing food 5  the woodpecker uses its bill for foraging as a chisel drilling into bark or probing cracks on trunk of trees 5  in this manner the red bellied woodpecker is able to pull out beetles and other insects from the tree with the help of its long tongue 5  this behavior is also seen for storing food from other animals by hiding food behind bark or deep in cracks of a tree 5  according to studies from williams 1975 breitwisch 1977 and batzil 1979 the red bellied woodpecker spent 20 to 69 foraging on dead or decaying trees in addition williams 1975 breitwisch 1977 and batzil 1979 observed red bellied woodpecker 80 gleaning and probing and 10 excavating on trees in south florida pine habitat 6  the red bellied woodpecker relies on snags or dying trees for foraging and nesting 7  the red bellied woodpecker is a major predator of the invasive emerald ash borer in the us midwest removing up to 85 percent of borer larvae in single infested ash treered bellied woodpecker foraging behaviorpredation edit predators of adult red bellied woodpeckers include birds of prey such as sharp shinned hawks and coopers hawks black rat snakes and house cats known predators of nestlings and eggs include red headed woodpeckers owls pileated woodpeckers gray rat snakes and black rat snakes when approached by a predator red bellied woodpeckers either hide from the predator or harass it with alarm calls they defend their nests and young aggressively and may directly attack predators that come near the nestbreeding edit in early may the red bellied woodpeckers begin breeding activities by drumming patterns such as slow taps followed by short rapid drumming 8  woodpeckers depend on dead and drying wood for nesting purposes the male red bellied woodpecker takes the initiative in locating a nest hole he will then seek approval from his female mate by mutual tapping 9  the red bellied woodpecker excavates holes in trees for nesting and roosting 10  by excavating cavities they play an important role in the forest communities for other species as well 7  for example species such as squirrels and bats use these cavities as shelter 10  the female red bellied woodpecker accepts the nesting hole by completing the excavation and entering the nest holeresearchers have documented that red bellied woodpeckers have the tendency to nest in clear areas with only few trees 10  studies have indicated that close canopy areas does not impact the birds nesting behavior however further studies are needed and are in progress 10  red bellied woodpeckers are territorial during the nesting season and they breed once per year a pair breeding woodpecker begins nesting in april or may holding a year round territories and showing high site fidelity 11 red bellied woodpeckers depend on dead trees for nesting 12  recent studies have shown that these woodpeckers experienced low breeding due to cutting sites of dead trees however predators are still of main concern 12  13  the juvenile red bellied woodpecker are ready to fledge its nest at 24 to 26 days of age natal dispersal has been observed on juvenile red bellied woodpeckers 11  the juvenile red bellied woodpecker remains approximately 27 weeks in its natal area after fledging 11  in some cases the woodpecker may return to its natal area for breeding depending on predation levels and food resources 11 courtship edit it has been noted that vocal signals in red bellied woodpeckers is used to attract and communicate with potential mates 9  a low grr grr sound is observed in a pair of woodpeckers from the start of courtship until the end of the breeding season 9  in an intraspecific conflict the red bellied woodpeckers usually make a loud chee wuck chee wuck chee wuck sound as indicated by kilham 1983 the red bellied woodpecker drums with its bill during conflict situation and taps to maintain pair bonding an example of a conflict event between red bellied woodpeckers would be competing for the same mate

red cockaded woodpecker   wikipedia the red cockaded woodpecker leuconotopicus borealis is a woodpecker found in southeastern north americadescription edit the red cockaded woodpecker is small to mid sized species being intermediate in size between north americas two most widespread woodpeckers the downy and hairy woodpeckers this species measures 18–23 cm 71–91 in in length spans 34–41 cm 13–16 in across the wings and weighs 40–56 g 14–20 oz 2  3  4  among the standard measurements the wing chord is 95–126 cm 37–50 in the tail is 7–82 cm 28–32 in the bill is 19–23 cm 075–091 in and the tarsus is 18–22 cm 071–087 in 5  its back is barred with black and white horizontal stripes the red cockaded woodpeckers most distinguishing feature is a black cap and nape that encircle large white cheek patches rarely visible except perhaps during the breeding season and periods of territorial defense the male has a small red streak on each side of its black cap called a cockade hence its name the species is listed as near threatened by the iucnbehavior edit the red cockaded woodpecker feeds primarily on ants beetles cockroaches caterpillars wood boring insects and spiders and occasionally fruit and berriesred cockaded woodpeckers are a territorial nonmigratory cooperative breeding species frequently having the same mate for several yearsthe nesting season runs from april to june the breeding female lays three to four eggs in the breeding males roost cavity group members incubate the small white eggs for 10–13 days once hatched the nestlings remain in the nest cavity for about 26–29 days upon fledging the young often remain with the parents forming groups of up to nine or more members but more typically three to four members there is only one pair of breeding birds within each group and they normally only raise a single brood each year the other group members called helpers usually males from the previous breeding season help incubate the eggs and raise the young juvenile females generally leave the group before the next breeding season in search of solitary male groups the main predators of red cockaded nests are rat snakes although corn snakes also represent a threat 6  6 distribution and habitat edit historically this woodpeckers range extended in the southeastern united states from florida to new jersey and maryland as far west as eastern texas and oklahoma and inland to missouri kentucky and tennessee today it is estimated that there are about 5000 groups of red cockaded woodpeckers or 12500 birds from florida to virginia and west to southeast oklahoma and eastern texas representing about 1 of the woodpeckers original population they have become extinct extirpated in new jersey maryland and missourimale at nest cavity in longleaf pinethe red cockaded woodpecker makes its home in mature pine forests longleaf pines pinus palustris are most commonly preferred but other species of southern pine are also acceptable while other woodpeckers bore out cavities in dead trees where the wood is rotten and soft the red cockaded woodpecker is the only one which excavates cavities exclusively in living pine trees the older pines favored by the red cockaded woodpecker often suffer from a fungus called red heart rot which attacks the center of the trunk causing the inner wood the heartwood to become soft cavities generally take from 1 to 3 years to excavatethe aggregate of cavity trees is called a cluster and may include 1 to 20 or more cavity trees on 3 to 60 acres 12000 to 240000 m² the average cluster is about 10 acres 40000 m² cavity trees that are being actively used have numerous small resin wells which exude sap the birds keep the sap flowing apparently as a cavity defense mechanism against rat snakes and possibly other predators the typical territory for a group ranges from about 125 to 200 acres 500000 to 800000 m² but observers have reported territories running from a low of around 60 acres 240000 m² to an upper extreme of more than 600 acres 240 km² the size of a particular territory is related to both habitat suitability and population densitythe red cockaded woodpecker plays a vital role in the intricate web of life of the southern pine forests a number of other birds and small mammals use the cavities excavated by red cockaded woodpeckers such as chickadees bluebirds titmice and several other woodpecker species including the downy hairy and red bellied woodpeckers larger woodpeckers such as northern flicker red bellied or pileated woodpecker may take over a red cockaded woodpecker cavity sometimes enlarging the hole enough to allow eastern screech owls wood ducks and even raccoons to move in later flying squirrels several species of reptiles and amphibians and insects primarily bees and wasps also will use red cockaded woodpecker cavitiesconservation edit the red cockaded woodpecker has been the focus of conservation efforts even before the passing of the endangered species act in 1970 in florida pairs are being released at dupuis management areadue to the high importance of nesting habitat on the woodpeckers reproduction much management has been dedicated to create ideal and more numerous nesting sites nesting clusters have been spared from forestry activity to preserve old growth large diameter trees the nesting sites themselves have also been managed to make them more appealing the use of controlled burning has been used to reduce deciduous growth around nesting colonies the red cockaded woodpecker has been shown to prefer nesting sites with less deciduous growth the use of controlled burning must be exercised with caution due to the highly flammable resin barriers formed by the woodpecker 7 in an effort to increase the red cockaded woodpecker population states such as texas louisiana alabama and georgias wildlife management are creating artificial cavities in longleaf pine trees there are two methods in which wildlife management officers use to insert cavities in long leaf pines the most respected and latest approach is to carve out a nesting cavity in the tree and insert a man made nest the older and less used approach is to drill a cavity into the tree in hopes that the birds will settle there and nest 8 due to the energetically expensive process of excavating new cavities more energy is expended competing for existing home ranges rather than colonizing new areas red cockaded woodpeckers will make use of artificial cavities and even recolonize abandoned ranges when cavities are created 9 in addition to the creation of new cavities methods for protecting existing cavities are also used the most common technique employed is a restrictor plate the plate prevents other species from enlarging or changing the shape of the cavity entrance these restrictor plates must be carefully monitored however to ensure that no hindrance is given to the woodpecker adjustments must also be made as the tree grows 10 see also edit

it looks quite different in other respectstaxonomy edit the red headed woodpeckers distinct colors are true to the birds namethe red headed woodpecker was one of the many species originally described by linnaeus in his 18th century work systema naturae 2  the specific epithet is derived from the ancient greek words erythros red and kephalos head 3 there are three subspecies recognizedm e

white secondary remiges adult males and females are identical in plumage 4  juveniles have very similar markings but have an all grey head 4  while red bellied woodpeckers have some bright red on the backs of their necks and heads red headed woodpeckers have a much deeper red that covers their entire heads and necks as well as a dramatically different overall plumage patternthese are mid sized woodpeckers both sexes measure from 19 to 25 cm 75 to 98 in in length with a wingspan of 425 cm 167 in 5  6  they weigh from 56 to 97 g 20 to 34 oz with an average of 76 g 27 oz 7  each wing measures

tchur tchur call or drum on territorybehavior edit these birds fly to catch insects in the air or on the ground forage on trees or gather and store nuts they are omnivorous eating insects seeds fruits berries nuts and occasionally even the eggs of other birds 4  about two thirds of their diet is made up of plants 4  they nest in a cavity in a dead tree utility pole or a dead part of a tree that is between 245 and 245 m 80 and 804 ft above the ground 4  they lay 4 to 7 eggs in early may which are incubated for two weeks 4  two broods can be raised in a single nesting season 4  northern birds migrate to the southern parts of the range with most having arrived on the breeding range by late april and having left for winter quarters by late october 9  10  southern birds are often permanent residentsconservation edit the red headed woodpecker is a once common but declining bird species found in southern canada and east central united states consistent long term population declines have resulted in red headed woodpeckers threatened status in canada and several states in the us this has led to an immediate need for conservation which so far has been the focus of limited studies throughout most of its range it inhabits areas that have been heavily altered by humans factors suggested for red headed woodpecker declines include loss of overall habitat and within habitats standing dead wood required for nest sites 11  limitations of food supply 12  and possible nest site competition with other cavity nesters such as european starlings or red bellied woodpeckers 13  14

white below with a long white eyebrow while similar in appearance to the carolina wren it has a long tail that is tipped in white the song is loud and melodious much like the song of other wrens the song is broken into two or three individual parts one individual male may exhibit up to twenty two different variations on the song pattern and may even throw in a little ventriloquism to vary it even further 2  it lives in thickets brush piles and hedgerows open woodlands and scrubby areas often near streams it eats insects and spiders which it gleans from vegetation or finds on the ground wrens are sometimes observed foraging with chickadees and other birdsits range is from southern british columbia nebraska southern ontario and southwestern pennsylvania maryland south to mexico arkansas and the northern gulf states the bewicks wren does not migratethe nest is cup shaped and located in a nook or cavity of some kind it lays 5–7 eggs that are white with brown spots the bewicks wren produces two broods in a season pairs are more or less monogamous when it comes to breeding but go solitary throughout the winter 3 this is currently the only species of its genus thryomanes the socorro wren

carolina wren   wikipedia the carolina wren thryothorus ludovicianus is a common species of wren that is a resident in the eastern half of the united states of america the extreme south of ontario canada and the extreme northeast of mexico severe winters restrict the northern limits of their range while favorable weather conditions lead to a northward extension of their breeding range their preferred habitat is in dense cover in forests farm edges and suburban areas this wren is the state bird of south carolinathere are seven recognized subspecies across the range of these wrens and they differ slightly in song and appearance the birds are generally inconspicuous avoiding the open for extended periods of time when out in the open they investigate their surroundings and are rarely stationary after finding a mate pairs maintain a territory and stay together for several years both sexes give out alarm calls but only males sing to advertize territory carolina wrens raise multiple broods during the summer breeding season but can fall victim to brood parasitism by brown headed cowbirds among other species some populations have been affected by mercury contaminationtaxonomy edit the carolina wren was first described under the name of sylvia ludoviciana by john latham in 1790 3  note 1  louis jean pierre vieillot considered all wrens under the genus troglodytes and called the carolina wren troglodytes arundinaceus but placed it subsequently in a separate genus thryothorus initially misspelled thriothorus  2  that he created in 1816 7  thryothorus is of greek origin from the combination of thryon rush reed and thouros derivative of verb throskein to leap up spring jump at which means reed jumper its specific name ludovicianus is a post classical latin term for ludovicus derivative from louis xiv that means of louisiana that identifies the locality of the specimen collected near new orleans 8  9 there are seven recognized subspecies of the carolina wren 3  10 t l ludovicianus latham 1790 – southeast canada southern ontario irregularly in eastern and southern quebec and the eastern united states southern wisconsin and new england southward to texas and

l tropicalis – northeastern mexico eastern san luis potosi and southern tamaulipast ludovicianus is traditionally placed within its own genus as its only representative of north america but recent dna work suggests it is closely allied with the bewicks wren 11  a distinct population in the yucatan peninsula of mexico belize nicaragua and in guatemala is treated as a separate species either known as cabots wren or white browed wren thryothorus albinucha 3  12  it is considered a subspecies of t ludovicianus by some authors however 10 description edit at 125 to 14 cm 49 to 55 in long with a 29 cm 11 in wingspan and a weight of about 18 to 23 g 063 to 081 oz the carolina wren is a fairly large wren the second largest in the united states species after the cactus wren among standard measurements the wing chord is 54 to 64 cm 21 to 25 in the tail is 45 to 56 cm 18 to 22 in the culmen is 14 to 18 cm 055 to 071 in and the tarsus is 2 to 23 cm 079 to 091 in 3  sexual dimorphism is slight with males being larger than their mates a study indicated that out of 42 mated pairs all but one of male was larger than the female of the pair the males were on average 11 percent heavier along with having longer wing chords 13 there are several differences among the subspecies for t l ludovicianus the crown is rich brown that appears more chestnut colored on its rump and uppertail coverts shoulders and greater coverts are a rich brown with a series of small white dots on the lesser primary coverts the secondary coverts are rich brown with a darker brown barring on both webs the bars on the primaries are on the outerwebs only but darker and more noticeable the retrices are brown with 18 to 20 bars that span across the tail the white supercilious streak borders thinly with a black above and below and extends above and beyond its shoulders the ear coverts are speckled gray and grayish black its chin and throat are grey that becomes buff on its chest flank and belly though the latter two are of a warmer color the underwing coverts sport a grayish buff color its iris is reddish brown the upper mandible is lemon colored and paler at the base and lower mandible the legs are flesh colored 3 as for the other subspecies in contrast to t l ludovicianus t l berlandieri is of a slightly smaller build but possesses a larger bill the upperparts are duller brown with deeper colored underparts t l lomitensis is of a duller color than either ludovicianus or berlandieri with its underparts either pale or almost white t l miamensis contains darker rusty chestnut upperparts and deeper colored below t l burleighi is duller and sootier with less distinct tail markings t l mesophilus has paler underparts and a whiter supercilium and t l tropicalis is darker than all races and contains heavier bars than t l berlandieri 3 plumage edit the juvenile tl ludovicianus is similar in appearance but the plumage is generally paler with a softer texture with buff tipped wing coverts a superciliary streak is less white a fluffy vent and crissum flanks without bars 3  14  in august and september the partial plumage molt for the post juvenile wrens is darker in color and affects the contour plumage wing coverts tail and develops a whiter superciliary stripe the post nuptial molt for adults in the same time period is more pronounced in color than the spring molt with both sexes similar in appearance 14 life span edit sketches of thryothorus ludovicianus tl lomitensis and thryomanes bewickii bewicks wren and one of its subspeciessurvival rates differ by region a male captured in arkansas lived to be at least 73 months old and in alabama the oldest female and male captured were six and ten years old respectively a mark and recapture analysis of the wrens analyzing survival probability within the southeastern united states captured was monitored from 1992 to 2003 roughly 90 percent of the banded wrens died within 10 years 15 similar species edit the easiest species to confuse with the carolina wren is bewicks wren 16  which differs in being smaller but with a longer tail grayer brown above and whiter below the carolina and white browed wrens differ from the house wren in being larger with a decidedly longer bill and hind toe their culmen has a notch behind the tip 17 habitat and distribution edit these birds are largely resident and will only disperse beyond their range after mild winters 3  carolina wrens sporadically breed as far north as maine and quebec after mild winters 3  18  in certain parts of their range such as most of iowa prolonged periods of snow can curtail potential expansion 19  permanent breeding locations range from eastern nebraska southern michigan southeast ontario and the new england states to mexican states such as coahuila nuevo león san luis potosí and tamaulipas and the gulf coast of the united states 15  local occurrences with infrequent and likely breeding locations include southeast south dakota central kansas eastern colorado western oklahoma and texas as far as maine and new brunswick 15  there have been occasional vagrants spotted in colorado new mexico and arizona wyoming south dakota manitoba nova scotia and the gulf of st lawrence 3  18 the range of the wrens increased northward and westward in several regions over the past few centuries in massachusetts the wrens had expanded westward and northeastward from its former southeastern location in approximately 35 years in new york the population increased three fold in roughly 25 years while in midwest states such as ohio and michigan have seen numbers of the birds increase since the mid 1800s and early 1900s respectively 15  expansion around ontario occurred since early reports in 1890 and 1905 explanations given include infrequent winter storms in the 20th century expanded forest habitats and the wrens taking advantage of urban areas containing feeders especially in winter 15 carolina wrens adapt to various habitats natural habitats include various types of woodland such as oak hardwoods and mixed oak pine woodlands ash and elmwoods hickory oak woodlands with a healthy amount of tangled undergrowth 3  20  the preferred habitats are riparian forests brushy edges swamps overgrown farmlands and suburban yards with abundant thick shrubs and trees and parks 3  20  it has an affinity for dilapidated buildings and unkempt yards in man made areas 20  subspecies burleighi and neophilus inhabit slash pine and palmettos 3  20 behavior edit song and calls edit carolina wrens sing year round and at any point during the daytime with the exception of performing during the most harsh weather conditions 20  the birds are also the only species in the certhiidae family that neither sings in duet nor has their song control regions affect repertoire size 21  males alone sing and have a repertoire of at least twenty different phrase patterns and on average thirty two 21  22  one of these patterns is repeated for several minutes and although the males song can be repeated up to twelve times the general amount of songs range from three to five times in repetition while singing the tail of the birds is pointed downward some general vocalizations have been transcribed as teakettle teakettle teakettle and cheery cheery cheery 14  20  various descriptions of the teakettle song include whee udel whee udel whee udel che wortel che wortel and túrtee túrtee túrtee and familiar names and phrases such as sweet heart sweet heart come to me come to me sweet william and richelieu richelieu 14 males are capable of increasing their repertoire through song learning but due to their sedentary nature and territorial defense habits the song learning must occur within the first three months of life 23  geographic barriers affect song repertoire size from male wrens as one study indicated that distances separated as close as 3 kilometres 19 mi by water barriers can have the same effect as that of a distance of 145 kilometres 90 mi in the mainland with no barriers 23 female carolina wrens possess song control regions that would appear to make them capable of singing with repertoires like the male due to vocalizations that they occasionally make with the male it has been suggested that song perception plays a role and is of behavioral relevance 21 carolina wren on rutland township forest preservedifferent subspecies have variations in songs and calls such as miamensis having a more rapid song that contains more notes than the races that are further north 3 their songs can be confused with the kentucky warbler the song patterns are similar but is of a different quality as the warblers songs is described as richer with more ringing and a hurried pace 20  other bird species that have their songs described as akin to the wrens are the flicker baltimore oriole gray catbird and more specifically the peto peto peto calls of the tufted titmouse and whistles of the northern cardinal 14  occasionally the wrens mimic other species and in pennsylvania it has led for it to be also known as the mocking wren 3 sexual selection edit a 2006 study suggested that the correlation of tail length and body size in males wing length in females and lifespan for both sexes were signs of individual quality and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals the courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle due to the large size of male wrens and the males vigor in defending its territory intrasexual selection was given as a possible explanation for the sexual dimorphism 13 territorial and predator defense edit both sexes are involved in defending the territory one aspect of territorial defense involves identifying the proximity of the threat based on the loudness of bird song as well as the level of degradation of the calls in experiments involving playback the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories such as songs under foliage 24  song degradation can also be used to determine the proximity of potential intruders if the song of a bird appears to be degraded the wrens will assume that the threat is distant not respond if the song is not degraded they respond by attacking 25  not all birds within their territory are potential enemies some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as dear enemies by the wrens and the responses to neighbors and intruders in their territories differ by the season in spring the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors though in the fall no major discrepancy in responses is shown 26  when protecting their nest alarm calls are the general response the wrens judge the size of the potential threat such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking 27  countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male carolina wrens 28 both males and females utilize calls in alarm situations especially in territorial disputes and encounters with predators males alone produce the cheer call which can sound indistinct in southern regions of their range the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing pink or pdink sound females are the only ones that can perform the paired dit dit or chatter sounds the former can be used in territorial disputes with predators and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant the chatter is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song and the song can either follow or overlap her mates song 21  29 feeding edit carolina wrens spend the majority of their time on or near the ground searching for food or in tangles of vegetation and vines they also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels or pick up leaf litter in order to search for prey their diet consists of invertebrates such as beetles true bugs grasshoppers katydids spiders ants bees and wasps small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets such as fruit pulp and various seeds in the northern portion of their range they frequent bird feeders 3  20 movement edit carolina wrens are wary and are more often heard than seen when on the ground they move in jerky hops pillaging through various objects whether man made or natural 20  while moving abruptly they pause momentarily for chattering or singing 14  when stationary they move in twitched motions jerking their breast around 20  they also sun  or sand bathe 30  the wrens also displays a skittish behavior when encountered by humans as they can be seen thrusting off into cover slowly if approaching is detected however they occasionally seek out humans that are near so long as there is no movement from them 14  other movements involve being capable of crawling like a creeper and hanging upside down like a nuthatch 20 flights are generally of short duration rapid low leveled and wavelike the wings during flight are flapped rapidly and are frequently used during foraging they are also capable of flying vertically from the base of a tree to the top in a single wing assisted bound 3  20 breeding edit carolina wren nesting in a duck nestboxcarolina wrens are both genetically and socially monogamous and will usually mate for life mate changing is rare 13  and there has been one possible instance of polygamy 3  during the winter season males are more responsible for guarding the territory females vary in succeeding to maintain winter territories without a mate 3  it has been suggested that the possibility of desertion and decline in care taking from males along with the need for security in resources year round prevent extra pair copulations from females as the mortality rate for carolina wrens peaks during the winter 31  along with thermoregulatory benefits roosting is thought to reinforce pair bonding and prevent divorce between mates 32 the nests are arch shaped structures with a side entrance and built of dried plants or strips of bark as well as horsehair string wool and snake sloughs males obtain nesting materials while the females remains at the site to construct the nest nests are located in fragmented or complete cavities in trees or in man made structures such as bird boxes buildings tin cans mailboxes or unorthodox places such as pockets of hanging jackets in sheds or in a tractor in everyday use 3  14  nests are from 1–3 m 33–98 ft from the ground and are rarely higher they occasionally can be built in sloping locations or at ground level 3 egg laying dates and clutch size vary by region in texas the time period is from late february to late august in iowa it ranges from late april to june 12  19  the clutch size is generally 3 to 6 eggs but can reach as high as seven in texas 3  12  the eggs are creamy white with brown or reddish brown spots and are more heavily marked at the broad end 3  the eggs are incubated by the female for 12–16 days after the young hatch they are fed exclusively on invertebrates and they fledge in 12–14 days as many as three broods may be raised by a pair in a single breeding season 3  in one study three of the 70 fledglings remained or defended territory adjacent to the natal area 15 male and females are involved in the process of provisioning at similar rates throughout most nest stages with the males providing slightly more in the nestling stages both sexes increase their provision rates as the nestlings grow in age 33 predation and threats edit brood parasitism by brown headed cowbirds is common with up to 25 of carolina wren nests being affected in certain regions such as oklahoma and alabama 3  15  cowbird parasitism peaks in april at 41 and is as low as 8 and 0 in july and august respectively female cowbirds sometimes eject carolina wren eggs before laying their own and even if host eggs are retained the size of cowbird eggs negatively affect the hatching success of wren eggs as a result cowbirds may have a significant impact on the reproductive success of wrens 3  15  the feeding rate for cowbird nestlings is higher than wren feeding rates and some have been raised to independence 15  this also can be detrimental to the survival of wren nestlings 15  a rare instance of brood parasitism by a house finch has been recorded 15  34  the rate of brood parasitism is thought to be lower in more natural and concealed nesting locations 15  body parasites such as the larvae of blowflies feed on nestlings and the blood loss weakens nestlings 15  fellow species of wren such as bewicks wren and the winter wren compete for nesting locations and food respectively 15 in virginia some carolina wrens populations show high levels of mercury in their blood and this is acquired from feeding all year round on spiders 35  note 2  spiders being at a higher trophic levels contain a higher concentrations of mercury through biomagnification than herbivorous invertebrates as these wrens are year round residents they are at a higher risk than other species to acquire mercury in its blood nest abandonment and failure to raise young were more common with higher mercury content 35  exposure and prolonged periods of cold ice and snow is thought to affect the wren nestling and adult populations respectively 15  wrens that outlast those winters reside in sheltered areas during the season 14 among the top predators of adult carolina wrens are domestic cats and snakes such as the canebrake rattlesnake 36  37  raccoons and black rat snakes also feed on wren eggs and nestlings 15 in culture edit south carolina state quarterin 1930 the south carolina federated womens club adopted the carolina wren as the unofficial state bird over the eastern mourning dove and pushed for its official state adoption until 1939 when the south carolina legislature named the northern mockingbird as the state bird in 1948 the legislature repealed their previous decision and the wren became the official state bird 38 in 2000 the carolina wren was featured on the back of the south carolina edition of the 50 state quarters 39 references edit  birdlife international 2012

house wren   wikipedia the house wren troglodytes aedon is a very small songbird of the wren family troglodytidae it occurs from canada to southernmost south america and is thus the most widely distributed bird in the americas 2  it occurs in most suburban areas in its range and it is the single most common wren its taxonomy is highly complex and some subspecies groups are often considered separate speciesdescription edit though living about 9000 kilometres 5600 mi away southern house wrens in são paulo brazil differ from their northern relatives in voice more than in looksadults are 11 to 13 cm 43 to 51 in long with a 15 cm 59 in wingspan and weigh about 10 to 12 g 035 to 042 oz 3  among standard measurements the wing chord is 47 to 53 cm 19 to 21 in the tail is 39 to 44 cm 15 to 17 in the culmen is 11 to 13 cm 043 to 051 in and the tarsus is 16 to 18 cm 063 to 071 in 2  the subspecies vary greatly with upperparts ranging from dull greyish brown to rich rufescent brown and the underparts ranging from brown over buff and pale grey to pure white all subspecies have blackish barring to the wings and tail and some also to the flanks all subspecies show a faint eye ring and eyebrow and have a long thin bill with a blackish upper mandible and a black tipped yellowish or pale grey lower mandible the legs are pinkish or grey the short tail is typically held cocked 4 this birds rich bubbly song is commonly heard during the nesting season but rarely afterwards there is marked geographical variation in the song though somewhat more gradual than in the birds outward appearance that can strikingly differ eg on neighboring islands in the caribbean 5  birds from far north and south of the species range nonetheless have songs that differ markedly 6 systematics and taxonomy edit the house wren is usually divided into three distinct subspecies groups and one or several distinct island endemic subspecies some or all of these are often considered distinct

the highest density in floodplain forests in the western great plains where it uses woodpecker holes as nesting sites in south and central america it can be found in virtually any habitat and is as indicated by its common name often associated with humans north american birds migrate to the southern united states and mexico for winter most return to the breeding grounds in late april to may and leave for winter quarters again around september to early october 7  these birds forage actively in vegetation they mainly eat insects such as butterfly larvae also spiders and snails southern house wrens rarely attend mixed species feeding flocks 8 reproduction edit audubons illustration of nesting house wrenthe nesting habits do not seem to differ significantly between the northern and southern house wrens at least they usually construct a large cup nest in various sorts of cavities taking about a week to build the nest is made from small dry sticks and is usually lined with a variety of different materials these include feather hair wool spider cocoons strips of bark rootlets moss and trash the male wren finds dry sticks which he adds to the nest once he is done the female inspects at the nest but if she does not approve of the construction she will throw any unwanted sticks to the ground after this process the female lines the nest nest cavities are usually a few meters above ground at most but occasionally on cliffs as high up as 15 m 49 ft and more at least in southern populations verification needed  they may be natural or man made often using bird houseshouse wrens are feisty and pugnacious animals considering their tiny size they are known to occasionally destroy the eggs of other birds nesting in their territory by puncturing the eggshell females that sang more songs to conspecifics that were simulated by playback lost fewer eggs to ovicide by other wrens female bird song in this species is therefore thought to have a function in competition and is not only displayed by males 9  they are also known to fill up other birds nests within its territory with sticks to make them unusable citation needed adult bringing food for young note begging callsdepending on the exact population the house wrens clutch is usually between two and eight red blotched cream white eggs 10  weighing about 14 g 0049 oz each and measuring c17 and 134 mm 067 and 053 in at the widest points only the female incubates these for around 12–19 days 10  and she will every now and then leave the nest for various reasons while she is on the nest the male provisions her with food

size see also bergmanns rule as the young near fledging the parents spend much of their time procuring food for them brood loss due to predation was found to be light in the southern andean yungas with predation of nestling young being almost insignificant 11  known predators of house wrens at the nest include cats rats opossums woodpeckers foxes raccoons squirrels snakes and owls adults away from the nests can usually avoid these predators although both small hawks and owls occasionally take free flying adult wrens 12 migrant populations are nesting within 6 weeks of returning from winter quarters leaving theoretically time for a second brood 7  13  in the subtropical montane forest of northwestern argentina and similar habitat the southern house wren breeds in the rainy summer months from late october to late december 11 in washington dc area house wren parents made significantly more feeding trips per hour in suburban backyards compared to rural backyards yet rural nestlings grew at a faster rate than their suburban counterparts in addition suburban parents spent less time brooding sitting on the nest compared to rural parents such results suggest that suburban backyard habitats offer house wrens food for nestlings that is inferior in either quality or quantity to what rural habitats offer food items may for example be smaller in suburban habitats and force adults to make more trips to the box 14 conservation status edit the house wren may have been displaced somewhat in some northern parts of its range by the introduction of the house sparrow but is still common and widespread throughout most of the americas it is not considered threatened by the iucn 1  though this would certainly not hold true for several of the island population if they turn out to be true speciessome taxa especially from the lesser antilles are rare and highly endangered or possibly already extinct several factors seem to have contributed to a varying degree to the decline of these

common yellowthroat   wikipedia the common yellowthroat geothlypis trichas is a new world warbler it is an abundant breeder in north america ranging from southern canada to central mexico the genus name geothlypis is from ancient greek geo ground and thlupis an unidentified small bird thlypis is often used in the scientific names of new world warblers the specific trichas is also from greek trikhas is a kind of thrush the word being derived from trikhos hair 2 description edit common yellowthroat in birds of americacommon yellowthroats are small songbirds that have olive backs wings and tails yellow throats and chests and white bellies adult males have black face masks which stretch from the sides of the neck across the eyes and forehead which are bordered above with white or gray females are similar in appearance but have paler underparts and lack the black mask immature birds are similar in appearance to the adult female first year males have a faint black mask which darkens completely by spring 3 there are 13 races of this bird these races differ mainly in the males facial patterns and the brightness of the yellow underparts the southwestern forms of this bird are the brightest and the yellowest below 4 the breeding habitats of these birds are marshes and other wet areas with dense low vegetation and may also be found in other areas with dense shrub however these birds are less common in dry areas females appear to prefer males with larger masks common yellowthroats nest in low areas of the vegetation laying 3–5 eggs in a cup shaped nest both parents feed the young 5 northern races are nocturnal migrants 5  wintering in the southern parts of the breeding range central america and the west indies southern forms are largely resident this species is a very rare vagrant to western europethese birds feed on insects which are usually captured in dense vegetation but sometimes caught in midair 5 the common yellowthroats song is a loud twichety twichety twichety twich its call is a soft jipsinging male yellowthroatpopulation edit despite a decline in numbers in some areas which is due to loss of favoured habitat this species is still very commonmigration edit routes of migration vary based on the season and location of common yellowthroats during fall migration from august to october common yellowthroats in canada western eastern and central us and regions outside of the united states all have unique migration routes when migrating in the fall months all adults and immature individuals tend to arrive at their migration destinations around the same time migration differences in timing and routes are also seen during the spring months from early february to late may in these same groups across the united states canada and other areas however males generally arrive at their destination site before the females during the spring migration months during both fall and spring migration many birds take time to rest during a stopover period some individuals stay at their stopover destinations for several weeks or months while others spend only a few days resting before they continue on in their migration patterns to their final destination 5 one place of study on common yellowthroat migration that is unique and worth noting is appledore island maine common yellowthroats here typically migrate to this island during the spring months displaying distinct patterns of movement and stopover ecology analysis of the common yellowthroat spring migration from april to june was observed by researchers from the department of biology at canisius college in buffalo new york to determine patterns of migration and time spent resting on the island before continuing on their journey birds returning for more than the second time arrive earlier than birds migrating to the island for their first time every year males tend to arrive on the island an average of five days earlier than females weighing more than the females upon arrival one possible explanation for the early arrival of males to this island is the ability of males to set up territories before the females arrive this could give them better access to resources and a higher likelihood of finding a female mate however both sexes spend about a week on the island before leaving 6 migration of common yellowthroats in florida has also been extensively studied in florida the common yellowthroat can be found more often in the southern peninsular region rather than the northern panhandle region closer to the mainland of the united states peak migration times of the birds in this region are during the last week of september through the second week of october not as much is known about spring migration in florida but the patterns appear similar to that of the autumn migration 7 future studies are needed to understand specific migration patterns of common yellowthroats in other parts of the united statesreferences edit  birdlife
